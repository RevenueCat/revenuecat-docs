## How to use Active Subscriptions Movement in your business
ARR is a common benchmark for subscription companies, and as such is a good way to measure the scale of your business. To understand what’s driving your ARR, segment by key subscriber segments like Store or Product Duration.

## Calculation
For each period, we multiply its MRR by 12 to yield the ARR for that period. Learn more about how MRR is measured [here](doc:monthly-recurring-revenue-mrr-chart).

    "0-1": "Any paid, unexpired subscription is considered active. Learn more [here](doc:active-subscriptions-chart).",
    "1-0": "Does ARR exclude subscriptions with auto-renewal disabled?",
    "1-1": "No, ARR includes normalized annual revenue from all active paid subscriptions – even if their auto-renew status is currently disabled.\n\nBecause of this, if churning subscriptions are not replaced by new paid subscriptions, ARR will be higher than actual realized revenue over a given period.",
    "2-0": "Are non-recurring subscriptions, consumable, or one-time purchases included in ARR?",
    "2-1": "No, since these purchases do not represent recurring revenue, they are not included in the ARR calculation.",
    "3-0": "Is ARR calculated before commission and taxes?",
    "3-1": "Yes, ARR is calculated using the gross price of your active subscriptions. Commission & taxes deducted by the stores would need to be additionally deducted from ARR to understand expected proceeds."
