The 'Entitlements' card gives you a quick glance at the current entitlement status for a user. You can see which product(s) or [Entitlement(s)](doc:entitlements) have been purchased, and when they'll renew or cancel.  

Like the 'Customer History' view, this card is generated from current purchase receipt saved for the user.

> 📘 Grace periods will extend expiration dates
> 
> If the expiration date seems further out then you expect, e.g. 16 days past when your monthly subscription should renew, that indicates the user is in a grace period due to a failed payment. The store will attempt to re-charge the user there's no action to take on your part.
