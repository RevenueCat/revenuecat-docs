Promotional subscriptions allow you to give a user access to premium content for a specific amount of time without requiring them to make a purchase or redeem a promo code. This can be useful for allowing beta users to preview content for free or resolving customer support issues.

# Granting Promotionals

To give a user promotional access to an entitlement choose the [entitlement name](doc:entitlements) and duration and click 'Grant'. You can grant multiple entitlements if you have different levels of access. You must be using RevenueCat [Entitlements](doc:entitlements) to grant promotionals.

Granting an entitlement from the customer page will go into effect immediately, but you may need to [refresh CustomerInfo](doc:getting-started-1#section-get-subscription-status) on the client to get the latest active entitlements. The promotional access will automatically be revoked after the selected duration. Note that promotional entitlements in the customer timeline will not show as "sandbox" transactions.

# Removing Promotional Subscriptions
Granted entitlements will automatically be removed after expiration. To remove access to an entitlement early, click the :fa-times-circle: icon next to the **Granted Entitlement** name.
