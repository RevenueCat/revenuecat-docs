# What is RevenueCat?

RevenueCat provides a backend and a wrapper around StoreKit and Google Play Billing to make implementing in-app purchases and subscriptions easy. With our SDK, you can build and manage your app business on any platform without having to maintain IAP infrastructure. You can read more about [how RevenueCat fits into your app](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/where-does-revenuecat-fit-in-your-app/) or you can [sign up free](https://app.revenuecat.com/signup) to start building.

# Requirements

Xcode 13.3.1+
Minimum target: iOS 11.0+

# Installation

To use this plugin, add `purchases_flutter` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/)  (and run an implicit dart pub get):
[block:file]
[
  {
    "language": "yaml",
    "name": "pubspec.yaml",
    "file": "code_blocks/🚀 Getting Started/installation/flutter_1.yaml"
  }
]
[/block]
Alternatively run this command:

```
 $ flutter pub add purchases_flutter
```

### Amazon Appstore 
The latest stable version of the Flutter SDK doesn't have support for the Amazon Appstore. If you would like to use our SDK with the Amazon Appstore, use the version tagged [amazon-latest](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-flutter/releases/tag/amazon-latest) and follow the [AMAZON_INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://rev.cat/amazon-flutter-instructions) docs to get set up.

## iOS Deployment Target 
RevenueCat is compatible with iOS 11.0 or higher. Flutter does not automatically set the iOS deployment target for your project. You need to make sure that the deployment target is set to 11.0 or higher. To do that, simply edit `ios/Podfile` and add the following line if it's not already there:

```
platform :ios, '11.0'
```
Set it to 11.0 or a higher version for RevenueCat to work.

## iOS Swift Version
RevenueCat requires Swift >= 5.0 to work. If the `Podfile` in your project's `ios` folder specifies a Swift version, make sure that it's at least 5.0, otherwise you may run into build issues.  

# Import Purchases

You should now be able to import `purchases_flutter`.
[block:file]
[
  {
    "language": "kotlin",
    "name": "Import Purchases",
    "file": "code_blocks/🚀 Getting Started/installation/flutter_2.kt"
  }
]
[/block]

{
  "type": "warning",
  "body": "If you're using other plugins like [mobx](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_mobx), you may run into conflicts with types from other plugins having the same name as those defined in `purchases_flutter`. \nIf this happens, you can resolve the ambiguity in the types by adding an import alias, for example: \n```dart\nimport 'package:purchases_flutter/purchases_flutter.dart' as purchases;\n```\nAfter that, you can reference the types from `purchases_flutter` as `purchases.Foo`, like `purchases.PurchaserInfo`."
