The RevenueCat App in Stripe's App Marketplace combines Stripe’s customer and billing data with enriched data from RevenueCat’s native cross-platform SDKs and subscription backend. Rather than context switching between RevenueCat’s customer details and Stripe’s customer profile in multiple windows, the RevenueCat App combines RevenueCat data into a single page view within Stripe. 

You will be able to do the following:
- Quickly navigate to RevenueCat customer and setting pages with convenient buttons 
- View RevenueCat customer metadata such as app user ID, last seen RevenueCat SDK version, last seen locale, and timestamps (first and last seen) when your customer interacted with your app
- View transaction events for Stripe, as well as cross-platform purchases across Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Amazon Appstore

# Setup
## Prerequisites 
The customer's Stripe fetch token must exist in RevenueCat in order for RevenueCat to find the Stripe customer. To read more about this, visit the [Send Stripe tokens to RevenueCat](doc:stripe#5-send-stripe-tokens-to-revenuecat) section of our Stripe documentation! 

## Installing the app
To install the RevenueCat App in Stripe, navigate to the [RevenueCat App](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/revenuecat) on Stripe's App Marketplace. Select the 'Install app' button.
