> The Airship integration is available to all users signed up after September '23, the legacy Grow and Pro plans, and Enterprise plans. If you're on a legacy Free or Starter plan and want to access this integration, migrate to our new pricing via your [billing settings](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/billing).

Airship can be a helpful integration tool in understanding what stage a customer is in and reacting accordingly. You can design and trigger personalized Airship messages to customers based on purchase behavior.  

Use your RevenueCat events to send Custom Events to trigger messages with Airship. This means you can design personalized Airship [Journeys](https://docs.airship.com/guides/messaging/user-guide/journeys/about/) and [Automations](https://docs.airship.com/guides/messaging/user-guide/messages/automation/about/) based on purchase behavior.

With our Airship Integration, you can:

- Send a message to a user whose subscription experienced a billing issue.
- Send reminders to your app's message center when a user's trial is about to expire.

With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in Airship, you'll be set to turbocharge your users' engagement ⚡️

For events that have revenue, such as trial conversions and renewals, RevenueCat will automatically record this amount along with the event in Airship.

# Setup

## 1. Set Airship User Identity

If you're using the Airship SDK, you can either send the channel ID to RevenueCat or set an Airship Named User to match the RevenueCat app user ID. The preferred method is to send the channel ID to RevenueCat. Either method you use will allow events sent from the Airship SDK and events sent from RevenueCat to be synced to the same user.

### Set Airship User Identity Using Channel ID

Setting the Airship channel ID in RevenueCat is the preferred way for identifying users in Airship. Call `setAirshipChannelID` on the Purchases SDK to have RevenueCat use the channel ID to send events to Airship.

  }

### [Advanced Alternative] Set Airship User Identity Using Named Users

**Setting the Airship channel ID in RevenueCat is preferred over using Named Users, even if you have a user authentication system.** However, if you're already using Named Users in your Airship integration, you have the option to set the Named User in the Airship SDK as the same app user ID as RevenueCat. Ensure [Named Users is enabled in your Airship dashboard](https://docs.airship.com/guides/messaging/user-guide/project/enable-features/#named-users).

  }

## 2. Send RevenueCat Events to Airship

After you've set up the _Purchase_ SDK and Airship SDK to have the same user identity, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the event names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your app in the RevenueCat dashboard and choose 'Airship' from the integrations menu
2. Add your [Airship app key and token](https://docs.airship.com/guides/admin/security/account-security/)
3. Select the location of your Airship cloud site
4. Enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or choose the default event names
5. Select whether you want sales reported as gross revenue (before app store commission), or after store commission and/or estimated taxes.
