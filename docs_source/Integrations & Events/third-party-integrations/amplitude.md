> The Amplitude integration is to all users signed up after September '23, the legacy Grow and Pro plans, and Enterprise plans. If you're on a legacy Free or Starter plan and want to access this integration, migrate to our new pricing via your [billing settings](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/billing).

Amplitude can be a useful integration tool for seeing all events and revenue that occur for your app even if it’s not active for a period of time. You can use Amplitude’s product analytics to find patterns in customer behavior and inform marketing strategies.

With our Amplitude integration, you can:

- Create a behavioral cohort of customers based on specific actions, such as watching a specific episode of a show after subscribing.  Follow a cohort throughout their lifecycle to realize overarching trends.
- Measure the path of a user from marketing material to the purchase of a subscription. 

With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in Amplitude, you'll be set to turbocharge your product analytics ⚡️

For events that have revenue, such as trial conversions and renewals, RevenueCat will automatically record this amount along with the event in Amplitude.

# Setup

## 1. Set Amplitude User Identity

If you're using the Amplitude SDK, you can set the User Id to match the RevenueCat App User Id. This way, events sent from the Amplitude SDK and events sent from RevenueCat can be synced to the same user.

Configure the Amplitude SDK with the same App User Id as RevenueCat or use the `.setUserId()` method on the Amplitude SDK.

[block:file]
[
  {
    "language": "swift",
    "name": "",
    "file": "code_blocks/🔌 Integrations & Events/third-party-integrations/amplitude_1.swift"
  },
  {
    "language": "objectivec",
    "name": "",
    "file": "code_blocks/🔌 Integrations & Events/third-party-integrations/amplitude_2.m"
  },
  {
    "language": "java",
    "name": "",
    "file": "code_blocks/🔌 Integrations & Events/third-party-integrations/amplitude_3.java"
  }
]
[/block]



## Send Amplitude User Identifiers to RevenueCat (Optional)

If your App User ID in RevenueCat is different than the User ID in Amplitude, you can use the Amplitude User ID and/or Amplitude Device ID to identify events by adding a key in [Subscriber Attributes](doc:subscriber-attributes).

| Key                  | Description                                                                                                      |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$amplitudeDeviceId` | The Amplitude [Device ID](https://developers.amplitude.com/docs/http-api-deprecated#keys-for-the-event-argument) |
| `$amplitudeUserId`   | The Amplitude [User ID](https://developers.amplitude.com/docs/http-api-deprecated#keys-for-the-event-argument)   |

If both keys are present, RevenueCat will send both the User ID and Device ID to identify events into Amplitude. If only one of the keys are present, RevenueCat will only send the available key. If no keys are present, RevenueCat will send the current RevenueCat App User ID. This property can be set and removed manually, like any other [Subscriber Attribute](doc:subscriber-attributes). For more information how Amplitude tracks unique users, view their docs [here](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003135607-Tracking-unique-users).

## 2. Send RevenueCat Events to Amplitude

After you've set up the _Purchases SDK_ and Amplitude SDK to have the same user identity, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the event names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your project in the RevenueCat dashboard and find the _Integrations_ card in the left menu. Select **+ New** 

![](https://files.readme.io/0c37a59-app.revenuecat.com_projects_85ff18c7_collaborators_1.png)

2. Choose **Amplitude** from the Integrations menu
3. Add your Amplitude API key
4. Enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or choose the default event names
5. Select whether you want sales reported as gross revenue (before app store commission), or after store commission and/or estimated taxes.

## Set Amplitude Region (Optional)

If your Amplitude account is hosted on EU servers, toggle the Amplitude Region field to `EU` in the Amplitude integration settings. The region defaults to `US`.

# Subscription Status Attribute

Whenever RevenueCat sends an event to Amplitude, we'll update the `rc_subscription_status` user attribute with any applicable changes, using one of the following values:

| Status              | Description                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| active              | The customer has an active, paid subscription which is set to renew at their next renewal date.                                    |
| intro               | The customer has an active, paid subscription through a paid introductory offer.                                                   |
| cancelled           | The customer has a paid subscription which is set to expire at their next renewal date.                                            |
| grace_period        | The customer has a paid subscription which has entered a grace period after failing to renew successfully.                         |
| trial               | The customer is in a trial period which is set to convert to paid at the end of their trial period.                                |
| cancelled_trial     | The customer is in a trial period which is set to expire at the end of their trial period.                                         |
| grace_period_trial  | The customer was in a trial period and has now entered a grace period after failing to renew successfully.                         |
| expired             | The customer's subscription has expired.                                                                                           |
| promotional         | The customer has access to an entitlement through a granted RevenueCat promotional subscription.                                   |
| expired_promotional | The customer previously had access to an entitlement through a granted RevenueCat promotional subscription that has since expired. |
| paused              | The customer has a paid subscription which has been paused and is set to resume at some future date.       

For customers with multiple active subscriptions, this attribute will represent the status of only the subscription for which the most recent event occurred. Therefore, we recommend using `rc_active_entitlements` to understand whether your customers have multiple active subscriptions to be accounted for.

Please note that since this attribute is set and updated when events are delivered, subscribers with events prior to our release of this attribute (during November 2023) will not have this attribute set until/unless a future event (renewal, cancellation, etc) occurs.
