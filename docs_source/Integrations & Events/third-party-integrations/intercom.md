> The Intercom integration is available to all users signed up after September '23, the legacy Grow and Pro plans, and Enterprise plans. If you're on a legacy Free or Starter plan and want to access this integration, migrate to our new pricing via your [billing settings](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/billing).

Intercom can be a helpful integration tool in understanding what stage a customer is in and reacting accordingly. You can use Intercom’s comprehensive communication and engagement system to retain customers.

With our Intercom integration, you can:

- Create Intercom filters for users that canceled free trials.
- Allow customer support to communicate with loyal users with access to all the information they need to solve their problem or even grant them a promotional subscription.
- Send an onboarding campaign to a user in a free trial

With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in Intercom, you'll be set to turbocharge your customer support ⚡️
