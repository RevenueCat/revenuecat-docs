> The Superwall integration is available to all users signed up after September '23, the legacy Grow and Pro plans, and Enterprise plans. If you're on a legacy Free or Starter plan and want to access this integration, migrate to our new pricing via your [billing settings](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/billing).

Superwall can be a helpful integration for optimizing pricing and understanding which paywalls are producing customers with the highest LTV. RevenueCat can automatically send billing, subscription, and revenue metrics to Superwall, a paywall SDK that lets you remotely update every aspect of your paywall. 

With our Superwall integration, you can:

- Create paywalls on-the-fly without shipping app updates
- Determine which paywalls have high trial conversion rates
- Find which product & paywall combinations have the highest LTVs
- Offer discounts to users who churn

# Setup

## 1. Set Superwall User Identity

In order to associate RevenueCat subscription data with Superwall paywall events, the RevenueCat app user ID must match the Superwall app user ID. You can read more about how Superwall handles user ID’s in their documentation [here](https://docs.superwall.me/docs/user-management). You can set up a custom app user ID in RevenueCat by following the instructions in our [Identifying Users](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/user-ids#provided-app-user-id) documentation.

## 2. Send RevenueCat events to Superwall

After you've set up the Purchases SDK and Superwall SDK to have the same user identity, you can "turn on" the integration from the RevenueCat dashboard. 

1. Navigate to your project in the RevenueCat dashboard and find the _Integrations_ card in the left menu. Select **+ New**

![](https://files.readme.io/db31ce4-app.revenuecat.com_projects_85ff18c7_collaborators_1.png)

2. Choose **Superwall** from the Integrations menu
3. Add your Superwall Token (Superwall settings > Integrations)

Remember to select _Add Integration_

# Testing the Superwall integration

## Make a sandbox purchase with a new user

Simulate a new user installing your app, and go through your app flow to complete the sandbox purchase.

## Check that the Superwall event delivered successfully

While still on the Customer View, select the purchase event in the [Customer History](doc:customer-history) page and make sure that the Superwall integration event exists and was delivered successfully.

## Check Superwall dashboard for the delivered event

Navigate to your Superwall dashboard > Users and search for the created app user ID. You will see events RevenueCat has dispatched to the Superwall under 'Recent Events'.
