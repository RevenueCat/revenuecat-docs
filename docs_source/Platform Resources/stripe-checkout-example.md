RevenueCat supports web payments through Stripe. This allows you to let users subscribe on your own website, and automatically unlock access to the same subscription content through the Purchases SDK.

If you don't have or don't want a full website, it can be unclear on how to proceed with integrating Stripe payments. This [sample project](https://github.com/RevenueCat-Samples/stripe-no-website-example) demonstrates how to use Stripe Checkout and webhooks to send purchase data to RevenueCat.

The easiest way to use this project is by deploying to Heroku instantly with the button below.
