# Error Handling

If the completion callbacks or listeners on asynchronous methods receive an error argument that is not nil, an error has occurred. 

With the exception of `NetworkError`, `PurchaseCancelledError` or `StoreProblemError`, retrying a failed operation with the same arguments won't succeed. For failed purchases, assume the user wasn't charged, unless a `StoreProblemError` occurred - in which case the user may or may not have been charged.

## iOS Errors
On iOS, when an error has occurred the completion callback will receive a `RevenueCat.ErrorCode` object. 

When investigating or logging errors, review the `errorUserInfo` dictionary, paying attention to the following keys: 
- `rc_code_name` contains a cross-platform error name string that can be used for identifying the error. 
- `NSDebugDescriptionErrorKey` contains a description of the error. This description is meant for the developer.

### Examples
[block:file]
[
  {
    "language": "swift",
    "name": "",
    "file": "code_blocks/🧰 Test - Launch/errors_1.swift"
  },
  {
    "language": "objectivec",
    "name": "",
    "file": "code_blocks/🧰 Test - Launch/errors_2.m"
  }
]
[/block]
## Android Errors
On Android, when an error has occurred, the `onError` listener will receive a `PurchasesError` object.

When investigating or logging errors, review the properties of `PurchasesError`:
- `code` contains the `PurchasesErrorCode` that can be used for identifying the error.
- `message` contains a description of the error. This description is meant for the developer.
- `underlyingErrorMessage ` contains a description of the underlying error that caused the error in question, if an underlying error is present.

### Examples
[block:file]
[
  {
    "language": "kotlin",
    "name": "",
    "file": "code_blocks/🧰 Test - Launch/errors_3.kt"
  }
]
[/block]
# Legend
When debugging errors, it's important to consider whether the error was thrown by RevenueCat, Apple, or Google. This can help you pinpoint where to look for a resolution.

Indicates an identical operation is already in progress. For example, making two identical purchase attempts at the same time.

**Resolution:**
Wait for the original operation to complete.
_______________________________________________________________________________
####🍎 🤖 📦 `STORE_PROBLEM`
**Problem:**
This error is forwarded from Apple/Google/Amazon and indicates there was a problem connecting to the App Store, Play Store, or Amazon Appstore. 

The problems that will trigger this on iOS:
- Apple server is down (more common in sandbox than production)
- [SKErrorUnknown](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerrorcode/skerrorunknown)
- [SKErrorCloudServiceNetworkConnectionFailed](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerrorcode/skerrorcloudservicenetworkconnectionfailed)
- [SKErrorCloudServiceRevoked](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerrorcode/SKErrorCloudServiceRevoked)
- An [SCA purchase flow](https://developer.apple.com/support/psd2/) was initiated.

The problems that will trigger this on Android:
- Google server is down
- [Google Play Developer API Quota exceeded](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/quotas)
- Invalid Android package name in the RevenueCat dashboard
- Google Billing Client [SERVICE_TIMEOUT](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingClient.BillingResponseCode#service_timeout) error

**Resolution:**
If everything was working while testing, you shouldn't have to do anything to handle this error in production. RevenueCat will automatically retry any purchase failures so no data is lost.

If this occurs while testing in sandbox you can try:
- Repeating the operation later.
- Create a new sandbox user on iOS.
_______________________________________________________________________________
####🤷 `SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION_FAILED`
**Problem:**

# Purchasing Errors

####😿 `RECEIPT_ALREADY_IN_USE`
**Problem:**
Indicates there is an identical receipt already in use by another subscriber. 

**Resolution:**
The user will either need to log in as the App User Id that already owns the receipt or [restore purchases](doc:restoring-purchases) to re-sync the receipt with their current account. We recommend checking out the ['Transfer purchases'](doc:restoring-purchases#transfer-purchases) restore behavior. 
_______________________________________________________________________________
####🍎 🤖 📦 `INVALID_RECEIPT`
**Problem:**
Indicates the receipt is malformed or invalid.

**Resolution:**
This error indicates an error with configuration and usually occurs in the sandbox environment.

If testing with StoreKit Configuration Files:
- Follow [StoreKit test guide](doc:apple-app-store#ios-14-only-testing-on-the-simulator) 
- Re-upload the StoreKit certificate after making any changes to products or code-signing
- All products in StoreKit file are listed in the [RevenueCat dashboard](doc:entitlements#revenuecat-configuration)

Some other places to check:
- Bundle ID and [shared secret](doc:itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret) are set correctly for your app
_______________________________________________________________________________
####🍎 `INVALID_APPLE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`
**Problem:**
Indicates that the Apple Subscription Key is invalid or not present.

**Resolution:**
In order to provide Subscription Offers you must first generate a [subscription key](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/ios-subscription-offers#subscription-keys).
_______________________________________________________________________________
####🍎 `MISSING_RECEIPT_FILE`
**Problem:**
Indicates there is no receipt file available on the device. This is more common in sandbox testing.

**Resolution:**
Make sure you're signed into the device with a valid Apple account. In Sandbox, you may have to make a purchase to generate a receipt before attempting the operation. This error can occur fairly often in the sandbox environment. In sandbox a receipt is generated when a user makes a purchase and is saved against the sandbox account. While in production a receipt is generated when a user downloads the app and is saved against the Apple account.
_______________________________________________________________________________
####🍎 `INELIGIBLE_ERROR`
**Problem:**
Indicates that the user is ineligible for the specific Subscription Offer. 

Some possible causes:
- User has already used this Offer
- Offer not available in specific region
- User has no current or previous subscription

**Resolution:**
If a user is not eligible for a Subscription Offer, be sure to update your UI to reflect normal pricing or terms. [`.paymentDiscount(...)`](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/ios-subscription-offers#fetch-payment-discount) is the best way to check for Subscription Offer eligibility. If you are testing in sandbox and already tested a purchase with that offer, you may want to [create a new sandbox user](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/apple-app-store#create-a-sandbox-test-account) to try again.
_______________________________________________________________________________
####🍎 🤖 `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS_ERROR`
**Problem:**
Indicates the device does not have sufficient permissions to make in-app purchases.

**Resolution:**
Make sure you're signed into a physical device with a valid Apple or Google account that has permissions to make purchases.
_______________________________________________________________________________
####🍎 🤖 `PAYMENT_PENDING_ERROR`
**Problem:**
Additional action is required by the user before granting entitlement. For example, a user might choose to purchase your in-app product at a physical store using cash, or a parental control on a child's device may require approval before purchasing. 

**Resolution:**
Confirm to the user that they've started the pending purchase, and to complete it, they should follow instructions that are given to them from Apple or Google.
_______________________________________________________________________________
####🍎 `PRODUCT_ALREADY_PURCHASED`
####🤖 `ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED`
**Problem:**
Indicates that the product is already active for the user.

**Resolution:**
If testing in sandbox:
- Subscription IAP: Wait for the subscription to automatically cancel and try again.
- Non-subscription IAP: Create a new sandbox user.

If this occurs in production, make sure the user [restores purchases](doc:restoring-purchases) to re-sync any transactions with their current App User Id.
_______________________________________________________________________________
####🍎 `PRODUCT_NOT_AVAILABLE_FOR_PURCHASE`
####🤖 `ITEM_UNAVAILABLE`
**Problem:**
Indicates the product is not available for purchase by the device or user.

**Resolution:**
Ensure you're attempting to purchase a product that's available for the device / user.
_______________________________________________________________________________
####🍎 🤖 `PURCHASE_CANCELLED`
**Problem:**
Indicates the user cancelled their purchase and was not charged. 

On iOS, this can also mean the Apple account already owns the product. The user can [restore purchases](doc:restoring-purchases) to re-sync any transactions with their current App User Id.

**Resolution:**
No action required. The user decided not to proceed with their in-app purchase.
_______________________________________________________________________________
####🍎 📦  `PURCHASE_INVALID`
####🤖 `DEVELOPER_ERROR`
**Problem:**
Indicates one of the provided arguments for the purchase was invalid, including the payment method.

The problems that will trigger this on Android:
- Google Billing Client [DEVELOPER_ERROR](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingClient.BillingResponseCode#developer_error)

The problems that will trigger this on iOS:
- [SKErrorInvalidOfferIdentifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerrorcode/skerrorinvalidofferidentifier)

**Resolution:**
Ensure the device payment method is valid and all arguments passed in are correct.
_______________________________________________________________________________
####🍎 🤖 `PURCHASE_NOT_ALLOWED`
**Problem:**
Indicates the device or user is not allowed to make the purchase.

The problems that will trigger this on Android:
- Google Billing Client [FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingClient.BillingResponseCode#feature_not_supported)

The problems that will trigger this on iOS:
- [SKErrorPrivacyAcknowledgementRequired](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerrorcode/skerrorprivacyacknowledgementrequired)
- [SKErrorPaymentNotAllowed](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerror/2330535-paymentnotallowed)
- [SKErrorCloudServicePermissionDenied](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerror/2335083-cloudservicepermissiondenied)
- [SKErrorOverlayInvalidConfiguration](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerror/3656407-overlayinvalidconfiguration)
- [SKErrorUnsupportedPlatform](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerror/3689489-unsupportedplatform)
- [SKErrorIneligibleForOffer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerror/3663443-ineligibleforoffer)
- [SKErrorClientInvalid](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerror/2330533-clientinvalid)

**Resolution:**
Make sure the device and user are allowed to make in-app purchases. Try the following troubleshooting steps:
- Make sure your device/emulator is completely updated.
- Try running on device. Sometimes the emulator glitches out and it must be restarted. Overall, testing on device is more reliable.
- Restart your device/emulator.
- Make sure you're logged in with a Google account.
- If you're running on an emulator, make sure it has Google Play installed.
