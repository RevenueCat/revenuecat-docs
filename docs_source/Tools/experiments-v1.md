With Experiments, you can remotely A/B test:

1. Product pricing
2. Product offers (e.g. trial length, trial presence, paid introductory offers, etc.)
3. The number and mix of products offered
4. Paywall imagery, copy, layout, and more with our Paywalls or Offering Metadata

Plus, you can run multiple tests simultaneously on distinct audience or subsets of the same audience to accelerate your learning.
