###  Test Snippets synced from local code

This was synced from GitHub actions when merging to main

Here is the code to configure the SDK:

```swift
// ../code_snippets/Swift/configure-1.swift
```

```kotlin
// ../projects/android/app/src/main/java/com/example/docstesterapplication/MainApplicationOnlyPlayStore.kt#L8-L14
```

If you're building for the Amazon Appstore, you can use flavors to determine which keys to use. In your build.gradle:

```txt
// ../projects/android/app/build.gradle#L37-L47
```

```kotlin
// ../projects/android/app/src/main/java/com/example/docstesterapplication/MainApplication.kt#L9-L20
```
