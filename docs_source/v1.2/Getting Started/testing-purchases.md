You don't need to make real purchases in order to test your subscriptions. You can make sure your subscriptions have been implemented correctly by using the sandbox environments provided by Google and Apple. These environments will behave as the real stores, without incurring any costs.

For more information, take a look at their official documentation:

- [Apple App Store: Testing in-app purchases](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/Chapters/ShowUI.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008267-CH3-SW11)
- [Google Play Store: Testing subscription features](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing#testing-subscriptions)
