Itâ€™s important to know which marketing efforts are most effective at acquiring new users and keeping them engaged. RevenueCat can integrate with your attribution provider to track how much revenue was driven by each source and ad network.

RevenueCat can help you understand precisely how much revenue your campaigns generate even if users stop opening up the app. By continuing to follow your cohorts whether they're active users or not, you'll know the long tail revenue generated by your campaigns.

Most attribution SDKs provide a way to report revenue from the device, but this completely fails to capture recurring revenue that occurs while a user is not using the app. With RevenueCat, you receive a full picture.
