Collaborators allow you to share apps in RevenueCat with other people without having to share any login credentials. You can limit the access of specific collaborators to "Admin" or "Read Only".

To invite a collaborator, send them an invite from the [Collaborators page under app settings.](https://app.revenuecat.com/app/collaborators) 

All collaborators can view customers and analytics. Only admins are able to make changes to your app's configuration.

When inviting a collaborators there are two permission levels that grant them different levels of access:
- **Admin** - Can view and make changes to settings, including inviting other collaborators. This is usually app owners or engineers that are integrating RevenueCat.
- **Read Only** - Cannot view or change settings. Perfect for people that need access to revenue metrics, customer transactions, etc. but don't need access to things like API keys.
