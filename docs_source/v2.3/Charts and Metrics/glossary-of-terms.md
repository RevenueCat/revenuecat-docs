* **Active Trials** - Current free trials that are active. This number includes trials where a user has opt-ed out of renewing.

* **Eligible Conversions** - Found on the Trial Conversions chart, this number indicates the number of trials that were set to expire in a given timer period.

* **Monthly Recurring Revenue** - Monthly Recurring Revenue is subscription revenue scaled to a 28-day standard month. Typically active annual subscriptions are divided by 12 and added to this number. MRR is a common metric used to evaluate the longer term health of the business.

* **Active Subscribers** - Number of active subscriptions, free trial or paid subscriptions that are active. 

* **Churn** - Churn is the percentage of subscribers lost in a given period. If you start the month with 100 subscribers, and 30 of them unsubscribe in that period, you have a 30% churn. The lower this number the better.
