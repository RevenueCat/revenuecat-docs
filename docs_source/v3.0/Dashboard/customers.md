The RevenueCat dashboard lets you view basic customer information, including a timeline of their purchases, and allows you to grant promotional subscriptions. This can be a great way to debug issues and help with customer support.

To view a specific customer's information, you'll need to know their [App User Id](doc:user-ids), or find them on the [activity page](https://app.revenuecat.com/activity/).
