To setup products for Android devices, start by logging into the Google Play Console. Google Play Console is Google's central hub for managing app releases, testing, in-app purchases, and more. 

This guide assumes basic knowledge of Google Play Console, as well as having an app setup and ready for adding in-app purchases. For more information, visit [Google's documentation and guides for Google Play Console](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/?hl=en#topic=3450769).

## Create an In-App Purchase

To create an in-app purchase, go to Google Play Console's 'All Applications' page and select your app from the list.

In the sidebar, select the 'In-app products' dropdown. Depending on your in-app product type, you will either choose Managed Products or Subscriptions.

After clicking Create, you will need to provide some metadata to Google about your in-app product:

- **Title**: A short name of the item, up to 55 characters
- **Description**: A long description of the item, up to 80 characters
- **Price**: Enter a price in your local currency, or choose a template
characters.
- **Product ID:** The product Id is a unique alphanumeric ID that is used for accessing your product in development and syncing with RevenueCat. After you use a Product ID for one product in App Store Connect, **it canâ€™t be used again across any of your apps, even if the product is deleted**. It helps to be a little organized here from the beginning - we recommend using a consistent naming scheme across all of your product identifiers such as:

>**`<app>_<price>_<duration>_<intro duration><intro price>`** 

- **app:** Some prefix that will be unique to your app, since the same product Id cannot but used in any future apps you create. 
- **price:** The price you plan to charge for the product in your default currency.
- **duration:** The duration of the normal subscription period.
- **intro duration:** The duration of the introductory period, if any.
- **intro price:** The price of the introductory period in your default currency, if any.

For example, using this format the identifier for a product that has a yearly subscription with a one week trial for $39.99 USD would be:
>**`rc_3999_1y_1w0`**
