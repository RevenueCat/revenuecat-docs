If the completion callbacks or listeners on asynchronous methods receive an error argument that is not nil, an error has occurred. 

With the exception of `NetworkError`, `PurchaseCancelledError` or `StoreProblemError`, retrying a failed operation with the same arguments won't succeed. For failed purchases, assume the user wasn't charged, unless a `StoreProblemError` occurred - in which case the user may or may not have been charged.

##iOS Errors
On iOS, when an error has occurred the completion callback will receive an `NSError` object. 

When investigating or logging errors, review the `userInfo` dictionary, paying attention to the following keys: 
- `RCReadableErrorCodeKey` contains a cross-platform error name string that can be used for identifying the error. 
- `NSLocalizedDescriptionKey` contains a description of the error. This description is meant for the developer. 
- `NSUnderlyingErrorKey` contains the underlying error that caused the error in question, if an underlying error is present.

###Examples:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "if let err = error as NSError? {\n                \n    // log error details\n    print(\"Error: \\(err.userInfo[ReadableErrorCodeKey])\")\n    print(\"Message: \\(err.localizedDescription)\")\n    print(\"Underlying Error: \\(err.userInfo[NSUnderlyingErrorKey])\")\n\n    // handle specific errors\n    switch Purchases.ErrorCode(_nsError: err).code {\n    case .purchaseNotAllowedError:\n        showAlert(\"Purchases not allowed on this device.\")\n    case .purchaseInvalidError:\n        showAlert(\"Purchase invalid, check payment source.\")\n    default:\n        break\n    }\n}",
      "language": "swift"
    },
    {
      "code": "if (error) {\n\n    // log error details\n    NSLog(@\"RCError: %@\", [error.userInfo objectForKey:RCReadableErrorCodeKey]);\n    NSLog(@\"Message: %@\", error.localizedDescription);\n    NSLog(@\"Underlying Error: %@\", [error.userInfo objectForKey:NSUnderlyingErrorKey]);\n\n    switch ([error code]) {\n        case RCNetworkError:\n            showError(@\"Network error, check your connection and try again.\");\n        case RCPurchaseNotAllowedError:\n            showError(@\"Purchases not allowed on this device.\");\n        case RCPurchaseInvalidError:\n            showError(@\"Purchase invalid, check payment source.\");\n        default:\n            break;\n    }\n\n}",
      "language": "objectivec"
    }
  ]
}

##Android Errors
On Android, when an error has occurred the `onError` listener will receive a `PurchasesError` object.

When investigating or logging errors, reveiw the properties of `PurchasesError`:
- `code` contains the `PurchasesErrorCode` that can be used for identifying the error.
- `message` contains a description of the error. This description is meant for the developer.
- `underlyingErrorMessage ` contains a description of the underlying error that caused the error in question, if an underlying error is present.

###Examples:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "with(error) {\n    // log error details\n    print(\"Error: $code\")\n    print(\"Message: $message\")\n    print(\"Underlying Error: $underlyingErrorMessage\")\n    when (code) {\n        PurchasesErrorCode.PurchaseNotAllowedError -> {\n            showAlert(\"Purchases not allowed on this device.\")\n        }\n        PurchasesErrorCode.PurchaseInvalidError -> {\n            showAlert(\"Purchase invalid, check payment source.\")\n        }\n        else -> {}\n    }\n}",
      "language": "kotlin"
    }
  ]

Ensure you're using the correct API Key from the RevenueCat dashboard and your [Play Store Credentials](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/creating-play-service-credentials) More details [here](https://support.revenuecat.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046398913-Invalid-Play-Store-credentials-errors). / [App Store Shared Secret](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret) are configured correctly. 
_______________________________________________________________________________
####üòø `NETWORK_ERROR`
**Problem:** 
Indicates a network error occurred during the operation.
