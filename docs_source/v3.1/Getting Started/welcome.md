RevenueCat is an open-source framework that provides a backend and a wrapper around StoreKit and Google Play Billing to make implementing in-app purchases and subscriptions easy. 
# How RevenueCat works

  * Configure your App Store, Play Store, and Stripe products in the RevenueCat dashboard
  * Configure integrations like webhooks, Slack, and Facebook Ads in the RevenueCat dashboard
