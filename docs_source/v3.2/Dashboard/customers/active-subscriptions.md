The 'Active Subscriptions' card gives you a quick glance at the current subscription status for a user. You can see which product(s) or [Entitlement(s)](doc:entitlements) have been purchased, and when they'll renew or cancel.  

Like the 'Customer History' view, this card is generated from current purchase receipt saved for the user.
