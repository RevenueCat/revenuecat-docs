Building apps can be tough, but we're here to help where we can! We try to be as responsive as possible to any questions submitted through our [Community](https://community.revenuecat.com). 

We also do our best to triage requests by severity, to make sure urgent issues get addressed first.

# Help with troubleshooting, best practices, and general questions

Our [Developer Community](https://community.revenuecat.com) is designed to be a place to discover and engage with other developers regarding best practices and questions around using RevenueCat.

**[Developer Community :fa-arrow-right:](https://community.revenuecat.com)**

# Help with your account, billing, or feature requests

For questions about your account, billing, or feature requests, you can contact RevenueCat directly from the Account Settings in your dashboard.

**[Contact Us :fa-arrow-right:](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/support)**

# Help with code

For help with code that's specific to your project, we recommend the awesome community on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/revenuecat). We're not experts in every programming language, so it can be tough to provide the best answers to specific coding questions outside of RevenueCat. Our engineers regularly monitor the `revenuecat` tag on Stack Overflow and jump in whenever they can help.

# Dedicated support

For dedicated support, or something custom, [contact sales](https://www.revenuecat.com/contact) for information about our Enterprise plans.

# Things out of scope

### Phone support
Since most of the support tickets we receive are technical, it's more effective for us to route requests to the correct resource internally and work through issues asynchronously. We currently don't offer a phone support option.

### General consulting services
We don't provide direct consulting or app development services. Our [Community](https://community.revenuecat.com) provides a great forum to discuss the design and architecture of apps.
