The `PurchaserInfo` object contains all of the purchase and subscription data available about the user. This object is updated whenever a purchase or restore occurs and periodically throughout the lifecycle of your app. The latest information can always be retrieved by calling `getPurchaserInfo()`:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "Purchases.shared.purchaserInfo { (purchaserInfo, error) in\n    // access latest purchaserInfo\n}",
      "language": "swift"
    },
    {
      "code": "[[RCPurchases sharedPurchases] purchaserInfoWithCompletionBlock:^(RCPurchaserInfo * purchaserInfo, NSError * error) {\n     // access latest purchaserInfo\n}];",
      "language": "objectivec"
    },
    {
      "code": "Purchases.sharedInstance.getPurchaserInfoWith({ error -> /* Optional error handling */ }) { purchaserInfo ->\n  // access latest purchaserInfo\n}",
      "language": "kotlin"
    },
    {
      "code": "Purchases.getSharedInstance().getPurchaserInfo(new ReceivePurchaserInfoListener() {\n  @Override\n  public void onReceived(@NonNull PurchaserInfo purchaserInfo) {\n    // access latest purchaserInfo\n  }\n  \n  @Override\n  public void onError(@NonNull PurchasesError error) {\n\n  }\n});",
      "language": "java"
    },
    {
      "code": "try {\n  PurchaserInfo purchaserInfo = await Purchases.getPurchaserInfo();\n  // access latest purchaserInfo\n} on PlatformException catch (e) {\n  // Error fetching purchaser info\n}",

    },

    },

It's safe to call `getPurchaserInfo()` frequently throughout your app. Since the *Purchases SDK* updates and caches the latest `PurchaserInfo` when the app becomes active, the completion block won't need to make a network request in most cases. 
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "Working with the cache",
  "body": "The SDK caches the user's subscription information to reduce your app's reliance on the network. Users who unlock entitlements will be able to access them even without an internet connection. The SDK will update the cache if it's older than 5 minutes, but only if you call `getPurchaserInfo()`, make a purchase, or restore purchases, so it's a good idea to call `getPurchaserInfo()` any time a user accesses premium content."

{
  "title": "Checking If A User Is Subscribed"
}
[/block]
The subscription status for a user can easily be determined with the `PurchaserInfo` and `EntitlementInfo` objects.

For most apps that only have one entitlement, the `isActive` status can be quickly checked for your entitlement Id. 
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "if purchaserInfo.entitlements[\"your_entitlement_id\"]?.isActive == true {\n  // user has access to \"your_entitlement_id\"                \n}",
      "language": "swift"
    },
    {
      "code": "if (purchaserInfo.entitlements[@\"your_entitlement_id\"].isActive) {\n  // user has access to \"your_entitlement_id\"\n}",
      "language": "objectivec"
    },
    {
      "code": "if (purchaserInfo.entitlements[\"your_entitlement_id\"]?.isActive == true) {\n\t// user has access to \"your_entitlement_id\"                \n}",
      "language": "kotlin"
    },
    {
      "code": "if (purchaserInfo.getEntitlements().get(\"your_entitlement_id\").isActive()) {\n\t// user has access to \"your_entitlement_id\"\n}",
      "language": "java"
    },
    {
      "code": "if (purchaserInfo.entitlements.all[\"my_entitlement_identifier\"].isActive) {\n  // Grant user \"pro\" access\n}",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "Flutter"
    },
    {
      "code": "if(typeof purchaserInfo.entitlements.active.my_entitlement_identifier !== \"undefined\") {\n  // Grant user \"pro\" access\n}",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "React Native"
    },
    {
      "code": "if(typeof purchaserInfo.entitlements.active.my_entitlement_identifier !== \"undefined\") {\n  // Grant user \"pro\" access\n}",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "Cordova"
    },
    {
      "code": "if (purchaserInfo.Entitlements.Active.ContainsKey(\"my_entitlement_identifier\")) {\n  // Unlock that great \"pro\" content\n}",
      "language": "csharp",
      "name": "Unity"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
If your app has multiple entitlements and you need to check if a user is subscribed to at least one you can also check for the entitlement Id in the `active` dictionary of `EntitlementInfo` objects.
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "if !purchaserInfo.entitlements.active.isEmpty {\n    //user has access to some entitlement\n}",
      "language": "swift"
    },
    {
      "code": "if ([purchaserInfo.entitlements.active count] > 0) {\n    //user has access to some entitlement\n}",
      "language": "objectivec"
    },
    {
      "code": "if (purchaserInfo.entitlements.active.isNotEmpty()) {\n  //user has access to some entitlement\n}",
      "language": "kotlin"
    },
    {
      "code": "if (!purchaserInfo.getEntitlements().getActive().isEmpty()) {\n\t//user has access to some entitlement\n}",
      "language": "java"
    },
    {
      "code": "if (purchaserInfo.entitlements.active.isNotEmpty) {\n  //user has access to some entitlement\n}",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "Flutter"
    },
    {
      "code": "if (Object.entries(purchaserInfo.entitlements.active).length) {\n  //user has access to some entitlement\n}",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "React Native"
    },
    {
      "code": "if (Object.entries(purchaserInfo.entitlements.active).length) {\n  //user has access to some entitlement\n}",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "Cordova"
    },
    {
      "code": "if (purchaserInfo.Entitlements.Active.Count != 0) {\n\t//user has access to some entitlement\n}",
      "language": "csharp",
      "name": "Unity"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
It's important to note that PurchaserInfo will be empty if no purchases have been made and no transactions have been synced. This means that entitlements may not exist in PurchaserInfo even if they have been set up in the RevenueCat dashboard.

  "title": "Listening For Purchaser Info Updates"
}
[/block]
Since *Purchases* SDK works seamlessly on any platform, a user's purchase info may change from a variety of sources. You can respond to any changes in purchaser info by conforming to an optional delegate method, `didReceivePurchaserInfo:`. This will fire whenever we receive a *change* in purchaser info *on the current device* and you should expect it to be called at launch and throughout the life of the app.

Depending on your app, it may be sufficient to ignore the delegate and simply handle changes to purchaser information the next time your app is launched. Or throughout your app as you request new `PurchaserInfo` objects.
[block:code]

If you also have a web app, or need to get a user's subscription status from outside of the *Purchases SDK*, you should use the REST API. You can read the full API reference [here](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference).

RevenueCat can handle refunds across iOS, Android, and Stripe for both subscription and non-subscription products. As soon as RevenueCat detects a refund, the `purchaserInfo` will be updated to reflect the correct entitlement status - no action required on your part! If you have questions about refunds, take a look at our [community article](https://community.revenuecat.com/general-questions-7/how-do-i-issue-a-refund-115) covering the topic.
