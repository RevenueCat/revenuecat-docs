RevenueCat does not require server notifications from Google Play, however doing so can speed up webhook and integration delivery times and reduce lag time for [Charts](doc:charts).

# Setup Instructions

[Google real-time developer notifications](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/realtime_developer_notifications) can be set up directly from the RevenueCat dashboard. This will set up a new subscriber to Google's subscription status notifications, which will not affect any existing subscribers you may already have in place.

1. **Ensure Google Cloud Pub/Sub is enabled for your project**. You can enable it [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=pubsub).

        "#d4e2f4"
      ],
      "sizing": "smart"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
2. Navigate to your **app settings** in the RevenueCat dashboard.
3. Scroll to the **Android configuration** section, and click '*Connect to Google*' under **Google Developer Notifications**.

      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
4. You will see a generated Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic ID, as shown below.

        198,
        "#eef2f2"
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
5. Click the **Copy** button to copy the topic ID to your clipboard.
6. Open the Google Play Console for your app and navigate to **Monetization setup**.
7. In the "Real-time developer notifications" section, paste in your topic ID, click on **Save**, and then the **Send Test Notification** button.

If you don't see any errors, the subscription is ready to go.
