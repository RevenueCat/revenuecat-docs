## Revenue
**Segments:** Yes
**Filters:** Yes
The Revenue chart displays the revenue generated during a period. This number will usually be a little higher that MRR as it is un-normalized and all the revenue from an annual subscription is charted the period it starts or is renewed. This chart also displays all revenue from non-consumable and consumable purchases, as well as non-renewing subscriptions. 

For more information on how we calculate the amount deducted for commission, fees, and taxes to yield our Proceeds estimate, check out [this page](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/taxes-and-commissions).
