Although RevenueCat keeps all of your subscriptions/in-app purchases in one place, at the end of the day, the stores (Apple, Google, Amazon, Stripe) are the ones actually processing your users' payments and sending you money.

Thus, you will need to create **Service Credentials** for RevenueCat to access these stores on your behalf.

Follow these store-specific guides below to create your Service Credentials:
- **[iOS / App Store Connect :fa-arrow-right:](doc:apple-service-credentials)**
- **[Android / Google Play Console :fa-arrow-right:](doc:google-service-credentials)**
- **[Android / Amazon Appstore :fa-arrow-right:](doc:amazon-service-credentials)**
- **[Stripe :fa-arrow-right:](doc:stripe-service-credentials)**
