# Google Subscription Model v2 - Current RevenueCat Support
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "title": "New Subscription Features - Google I/O 2022",
  "body": "Due to the [recent announcements from Google](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/google-i-o-2022-announcement/), RevenueCat is not yet compatible with all functionality for subscriptions in the Play Console. At this time, please refrain from adding multiple base plans per subscription, adding multiple offers per base plan, or setting up prepaid base plans. The instructions on this page reflect these restrictions.\n\nRevenueCat is actively working on supporting Google’s new features. Read more in the [RevenueCat Community](https://community.revenuecat.com/tips%2Ddiscussion%2D56/google%2Di%2Do%2D22%2Dannouncements%2Drc%2Dproduct%2Dpriorities%2D1620)."
}
[/block]
For now, if you need multiple durations for a subscription, please create a new subscription and base plan for each. Your single base plan and (optional) associated offer should each be marked with a "Backwards Compatible" badge. If you don't see one, click the overflow menu and select "Use for deprecated billing methods".

See below for an example of a fully backwards compatible subscription in the dashboard.

## Existing customers
For customers with products set up in both the Play Console and RevenueCat before May 11th, 2022, these products will continue to work as expected -- Google updated existing subscription products to the new format with backwards compatibility. 

Here's a breakdown of what you can expect in the new Google Play console:
* Your original Google subscriptions' product IDs are the same in this new subscription model.
* Google created a base plan with an auto-generated ID for each original subscription, with the duration of the subscription from your original setup. This is the base plan that will be purchased via RevenueCat. RevenueCat doesn't need these base plan IDs yet. 
* If you had a free trial and/or introductory price on the original subscription, a single offer was auto-generated by Google and attached to the new base plan. If you had both, you'll see them represented as pricing phases in that single offer.

These auto-generated base plans and offers should be marked with a "Backwards Compatible" badge in the console. They will all continue to work as expected without any changes on your or RevenueCat's side.

## Making Subscriptions Editable, InAppProduct API

**RevenueCat does not use the InAppProduct API.** You are safe to make subscriptions editable, **unless** you are manually using this API outside of RevenueCat.

If you are relying solely on RevenueCat for your subscriptions, you can safely select "Make editable".

Additionally, note that there are no changes to one-time products (i.e. any products configured under the "In-app products" section of the Play Console).

# The Google Play Console

To set up products for Android devices, start by logging into the Google Play Console. Google Play Console is Google's central hub for managing app releases, testing, in-app purchases, and more. 

This guide assumes basic knowledge of Google Play Console, as well as having an app set up and ready for adding in-app purchases. For more information, visit [Google's documentation and guides for Google Play Console](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/?hl=en#topic=3450769).

# Create an In-App Product or Subscription

  "body": "You'll need to have an APK uploaded before you can create in-app products. Check out our guide on [sandbox testing on Android](doc:google-play-store) for details on how to upload an APK and roll out a release on a closed test track."
}
[/block]
To create an in-app product or subscription, go to Google Play Console's 'All Applications' page and select your app from the list.

In the sidebar, select the **Products** dropdown. Depending on your in-app product type, you will either choose **In-app products** or **Subscriptions**.

      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
After clicking Create, provide a couple pieces of metadata to Google:
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Metadata",
    "h-1": "Description",
    "0-0": "Product ID",
    "0-1": "The product ID is a unique alphanumeric ID that is used for accessing your product in development and syncing with RevenueCat. After you use a Product ID for one product in Google Play Console, **it can’t be used again across any of your apps, even if the product is deleted**.",
    "1-0": "Name",
    "1-1": "A short name of the item, up to 55 characters. This will be displayed on your Google Play Store listing."
  },
  "cols": 2,
  "rows": 2
}
[/block]
## Tips for creating robust product IDs

After you use a Product ID for one product in Google Play Console, **it can’t be used again across any of your apps, even if the product is deleted**. It helps to be a little organized here from the beginning - we recommend using a consistent naming scheme across all of your product identifiers such as:

>**`<app>_<price>_<duration>_<intro duration><intro price>`** 

- **app:** Some prefix that will be unique to your app, since the same product Id cannot but used in any future apps you create. 
- **price:** The price you plan to charge for the product in your default currency.
- **duration:** The duration of the associated base plan's billing period.
- **intro duration:** The duration of the introductory period, if any.
- **intro price:** The price of the introductory period in your default currency, if any.

For example, using this format the identifier for a product that has a yearly subscription with a one week trial for $39.99 USD would be:
>**`rc_3999_1y_1w0`**

## Create a base plan

Next, you'll need to add a base plan. Base plans define a billing period, price, and renewal type for purchasing your subscription. Click "Add base plan" and fill out the associated fields. Make sure to set a price, and click "Activate".

Once complete, return to the subscription screen and ensure that the base plan has a Backwards Compatible badge. If you don't see one, click the overflow menu on the base plan and select "Use for deprecated billing methods".

        "#f3f3f3"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
**Keep in mind that the "Prepaid" renewal type is not yet supported by RevenueCat, and only one base plan per subscription will work with RevenueCat at this time.**

        1084,
        "#fbfbfb"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## (Optional) Create an offer

If you wish to create a promotion for your base plan, you can do so from the subscription page by clicking "Add offer". 



[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/63e2cad-Screen_Shot_2022-06-30_at_3.58.40_PM.png",
        "Screen Shot 2022-06-30 at 3.58.40 PM.png",
        1754,
        1120,
        "#fafbfb"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": []
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
You can then select a product ID, eligibility, and offer phases. As with your base plans, ensure that the offer has a Backwards Compatible badge upon returning to the subscription screen. If you don't see one, click the overflow menu on the base plan and select "Use for deprecated billing methods".


[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/f309ab8-Screen_Shot_2022-07-07_at_2.12.18_PM.png",
        "Screen Shot 2022-07-07 at 2.12.18 PM.png",
        869,
        73,
        "#f3f3f3"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
At this point, only one offer at a time can be backwards compatible at once, and additional offers will not work with RevenueCat.
