Observer Mode enables you to do a partial implementation of RevenueCat's SDK, giving you access to the advanced charting, webhooks, and attribution that RevenueCat providesâ€”without affecting your existing purchase code. This is useful if you already have a functioning subscription system to manage your purchases and have infrastructure or code policy restrictions that prevent you from fully integrating third-party software.

When you set up and instantiate *Purchases* in Observer Mode, your receipts will be recorded and stored in the RevenueCat backend without interfering with any of your existing code. On iOS, your receipts will be recorded automatically. On Android, use `syncPurchases` after purchases and restores to record your receipts in RevenueCat.

# 2. Sync purchases with RevenueCat (Android only)

On Android (or cross-platform SDKs), any time a purchase or restore occurs in your app you should call the `syncPurchases` method to record it in RevenueCat. 
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "// Called any time a purchase or restore \n// is successful in your existing code\nPurchases.sharedInstance.syncPurchases()\n  ",
      "language": "kotlin"
    },
    {
      "code": "// Called any time a purchase or restore \n// is successful in your existing code\nPurchases.getSharedInstance().syncPurchases();\n",
      "language": "java"
    },
    {
      "code": "// Called any time a purchase or restore \n// is successful in your existing code\nPurchases.syncPurchases();",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "React Native"
    }
  ]
}

  "type": "success",
  "title": "You've done it!",
  "body": "That's all there is to it to enable RevenueCat in your app! At this point, RevenueCat is tracking purchases and granting access to any entitlements attached to tracked product identifiers. However it's important to note that there are certain features that can only be enabled with a deeper SDK integration. When that time comes, head back to our [Quickstart guide](doc:getting-started-1) to get set up."
