RevenueCat makes it easy to determine subscription status and more with the _Purchases SDK_ and [REST API](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference).

## Get User Information

The <<glossary:CustomerInfo>> object contains all of the purchase and subscription data available about the user. This object is updated whenever a purchase or restore occurs and periodically throughout the lifecycle of your app. The latest information can always be retrieved by calling `getCustomerInfo()`:

[block:file]
{"language":"swift","name":"","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_1.swift"}

{"language":"objectivec","name":"","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_2.m"}

[/block]

It's safe to call `getCustomerInfo()` frequently throughout your app. Since the SDK updates and caches the latest <<glossary:CustomerInfo>> when the app becomes active, the completion block won't need to make a network request in most cases. 

> ðŸ“˜ Working with the cache
> 
> The SDK caches the user's subscription information to reduce your app's reliance on the network. Users who unlock entitlements will be able to access them even without an internet connection. The SDK will update the cache if it's older than 5 minutes, but only if you call `getCustomerInfo()`, make a purchase, or restore purchases, so it's a good idea to call `getCustomerInfo()` any time a user accesses premium content.

The `CustomerInfo` object gives you access to the following information about a user:

[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Name",
    "h-1": "Description",
    "0-0": "Request Date",
    "0-1": "The server date when the current <<glossary:CustomerInfo>> object was fetched. This is affected by the cache on device so you should not use it when you need the current time to calculate info such as time elapsed since purchase date. For that you should use device time.",

## Get Entitlement Information

The `EntitlementInfo` object gives you access to all of the information about the status of a user's entitlements.

[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Name",
    "h-1": "Description",
    "0-0": "Identifier",

    "4-1": "The period type this entitlement is in, can be one of:  \n- Trial: In a free trial period  \n- Promotional: In a promotional period  \n- Intro: In an introductory price period  \n- Normal: In the default period",
    "5-0": "Latest Purchase Date",
    "5-1": "The latest purchase or renewal date for this entitlement.",
    "6-0": "Original Purchase Date",
    "6-1": "The first date this entitlement was purchased. May be the same as the latest purchase date.",
    "7-0": "Expiration Date",
    "7-1": "The expiration date for the entitlement, can be null for lifetime access. If the period type is trial then this is the trial expiration date.",
    "8-0": "Store",

    "9-1": "Whether this entitlement was unlocked from a sandbox or production purchase.",
    "10-0": "Unsubscribe Detected At",
    "10-1": "The date an unsubscribe was detected. An unsubscribe **does not** mean that the entitlement is inactive.  \n  \nNote there may be a multiple hour delay between the value of this property and the actual state in the App Store / Play Store.

## Checking If A User Is Subscribed

The subscription status for a user can easily be determined with the `CustomerInfo` and `EntitlementInfo` objects.

For most apps that only have one entitlement, the `isActive` status can be quickly checked for your entitlement ID. 

[block:file]
{"language":"swift","name":"","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_9.swift"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"objectivec","name":"","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_10.m"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"kotlin","name":"","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_11.kt"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"java","name":"","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_12.java"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"javascript","name":"Flutter","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_13.js"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"javascript","name":"React Native","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_14.js"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"javascript","name":"Cordova","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_15.js"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"csharp","name":"Unity","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_16.cs"}
[/block]

If your app has multiple entitlements and you need to check if a user is subscribed to at least one you can also check for the entitlement Id in the `active` dictionary of `EntitlementInfo` objects.

[block:file]
{"language":"swift","name":"","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_17.swift"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"objectivec","name":"","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_18.m"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"kotlin","name":"","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_19.kt"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"java","name":"","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_20.java"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"javascript","name":"Flutter","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_21.js"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"javascript","name":"React Native","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_22.js"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"javascript","name":"Cordova","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_23.js"}
[/block]
[block:file]
{"language":"csharp","name":"Unity","file":"code_blocks/ðŸ‘¥ Customers/customer-info_24.cs"}
[/block]

It's important to note that <<glossary:CustomerInfo>> will be empty if no purchases have been made and no transactions have been synced. This means that entitlements may not exist in CustomerInfo even if they have been set up in the RevenueCat dashboard.

## Listening For CustomerInfo Updates

Since _Purchases_ SDK works seamlessly on any platform, a user's <<glossary:CustomerInfo>> may change from a variety of sources. You can respond to any changes in CustomerInfo by conforming to an optional delegate method, `purchases:receivedUpdated:`. This will fire whenever we receive a _change_ in CustomerInfo _on the current device_ and you should expect it to be called at launch and throughout the life of the app.

CustomerInfo updates are not pushed to your app from the RevenueCat backend, updates can only happen from an outbound network request to RevenueCat.

Depending on your app, it may be sufficient to ignore the delegate and simply handle changes to customer information the next time your app is launched. Or throughout your app as you request new `CustomerInfo` objects.

[/block]

## Web Apps

If you also have a web app, or need to get a user's subscription status from outside of the _Purchases SDK_, you should use the REST API. You can read the full API reference [here](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference).

## Handling Refunds

RevenueCat can handle refunds across all platforms for both subscription and non-subscription products. As soon as RevenueCat detects a refund, the <<glossary:CustomerInfo>> will be updated to reflect the correct entitlement status - no action required on your part! If you have questions about refunds, take a look at our [community article](https://community.revenuecat.com/general-questions-7/how-do-i-issue-a-refund-115) covering the topic.

> ðŸ“˜ Granting refunds for Google Play subscriptions
> 
> In order for RevenueCat to detect refunds for Google Play, you must grant the refund via the [RevenueCat dashboard](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/customer-history#refunding-purchases) or [API](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference#revoke-a-google-subscription).
> 
> Refunds granted via the Google Play Console are not properly detected as refunds in RevenueCat.
