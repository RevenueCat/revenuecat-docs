RevenueCat charts allow you to understand your user base with key subscription specific metrics, filters, and segments. All charts are generated from the current snapshot of purchase receipts saved in RevenueCat and work independently from any in-app usage.

This means that your charts are always up-to-date, without having to rely on any client-side event logging. However, since receipt files are dynamic, this means even historical data may change from day-to-day if for example a user was refunded. This also means that data in RevenueCat may be different than other systems tracking similar metrics - see the section on [Differences In Data](doc:charts#differences-in-data) for more information.

# Data Discrepancies
Reconciling data between multiple sources is a fundamental challenge for all analytics systems. As a consequence, in-app purchase data from Apple, Google, or Stripe may not match what RevenueCat reports in Charts or in [Overview](doc:overview). Common reasons for these discrepancies are:
  * You migrated your app to RevenueCat (receipts must be sent through our SDK or API to be counted in Charts)
  * There is a disagreement between the store and RevenueCat over a definition (e.g., Apple uses fiscal months, whereas RevenueCat uses calendar months; Google considers trials to be active subscriptions, whereas RevenueCat does not)
  * RevenueCat makes an estimation in the absence of clear guidance from the store (e.g., currency conversions, taxes, price changes)

When reporting tax information, please use the data provided by the payment processor (i.e., Apple, Google, Stripe), instead of RevenueCat data.

Please see our [community post](https://community.revenuecat.com/featured-articles-55/about-data-discrepancies-116) for a more in-depth discussion of data discrepancies.

# Recreating Our Charts
Calculating in-app purchase metrics at scale is a complex process: Each of our metrics entail making decisions as to how users are grouped (i.e., cohorts), how users with different subscription histories are compared, etc.

We strive to provide clear and accurate insights into your data, but we cannot guarantee that our Charts definitions will match third-party definitions of similar metrics.

# Charts
For detailed information on a particular Chart, refer to the following guides:

# Filters and Segments

All charts can be filtered, while subscription, revenue, and active trial charts can be filtered and/or segmented.

Filters allow you to limit the charts to only include data that matches one or more attributes. This is useful when you want to check the performance of a specific property, such as a certain country or product identifier. 

Segments allow you to break down the chart totals into underlying data segments. This is useful for comparing the performance of specific properties, such as monthly vs. annual subscriptions.

# Exporting Data

The underlying chart data can be exported in .csv format by clicking the *Export CSV* button.

# Saving Charts
Your most frequently used chart configurations can be saved by clicking on the *Save* button. This will save all settings such as segments, filters, time / period settings, and bar / line view.

Time settings are saved relatively. Meaning if you select "last 7 days", the chart will always show the last 7 days prior to the current day (not the 7 days prior to the date the chart was saved). This does not apply to custom timeframes.

Give it a name and select *Save*, your chart will be saved on the left-hand side.

# Refunds
Whenever a subscription is refunded, that subscription is counted as active between its start date and the refund date. Any refunded revenue is removed from all revenue-based charts. You can use the [Refund Rate](#refund-rate) chart to gain additional insights into how many of your subscriptions get refunded, and how that refund rate develops over time.
