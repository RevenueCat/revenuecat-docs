## Active Subscriptions Movement
**Segments:** No
**Filters:** Yes
The Active Subscriptions Movement chart shows the increases and decreases to Active Subscriptions caused by new and churned subscriptions.

New Actives are new subscriptions started in that period. Churned Actives counts subscriptions that exceeded their expiration date without renewing or that were refunded, minus any previously churned subscribers that re-subscribed. Churned Actives can be negative if there were more re-subscriptions than churned subscriptions during the period. Movement is the difference between the two and represents the net change of Active Subscriptions.

Dissecting the movement of your Active Subscriptions is a good way to understand what is causing your subscription base to grow or shrink.
