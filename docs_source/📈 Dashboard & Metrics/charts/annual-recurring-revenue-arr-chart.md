## Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
**Segments:** Yes
**Filters:** Yes
The Annual Recurring Revenue, or ARR, chart is an annualized estimation of your recurring revenue. It is computed by multiplying [MRR](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/monthly-recurring-revenue-mrr-chart) by 12. Non-recurring subscriptions, consumable, or one-time purchases are not computed in ARR. Also, a subscription contributes to ARR until it expires, the auto-renew status has no effect. Note that ARR calculations excludes store cuts.

ARR is an important metric to track as it is a common benchmark for subscription companies and is a good way to assess scale of your existing business.
