### 1. Purchase History Usage

At the **bare minimum**, you must select the following options for 'Purchase History':

        "https://files.readme.io/2330c00-Screen_Shot_2020-11-11_at_9.48.00_AM.png",

      ],
      "border": true,
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
**All RevenueCat users must select these two options.**

- Selecting ‚ÄòAnalytics‚Äô ensures compliance for RevenueCat‚Äôs dashboard features including Customer History, Charts, and Experiments.
- Selecting ‚ÄòApp Functionality‚Äô ensures compliance for RevenueCat‚Äôs receipt validation in order to prevent fraud, as well as enabling features via Entitlements.

  "type": "info",
  "body": "If you are using RevenueCat for any of the other options listed, such as collecting data for Third-Party Advertising, you will need to select those options as well.",
  "title": "Additional Selections"
}
[/block]
After selecting these options for Purchase History, click ‚ÄòNext‚Äô.

### 2. Purchase History Linked to Identity

Apple will now ask if you are linking purchase history to a user‚Äôs identity. If you are using RevenueCat‚Äôs anonymous app user ID‚Äôs, and do not have a way to identify individual users, you can select ‚ÄòNo‚Äô.

If you are using an app user ID that can be tied to a user‚Äôs email address or other contact information via your own server or other third-parties, you should select ‚ÄòYes‚Äô.

### 3. Purchase History User Tracking

Finally, to indicate if purchase history data will be used for tracking purposes, you will need to read Apple‚Äôs examples and determine if your app meets their definitions of tracking. 

RevenueCat, as a third-party, does not inherently use purchase history to track users across different apps for advertising. If you are using integrations or other SDK‚Äôs that do this, you may need to disclose that here.

      ],

      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}

## Type: Identifiers

If you selected 'Yes' to linking purchase history to a user's identity, you will likely need to disclose which user identifiers you use in your app.

      ],
      "border": true,
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
If you are [identifying users](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/user-ids) with a custom app user ID, you will need to select 'User ID'.

If you are using integrations that utilize an advertising identifier, like IDFA, you will need to select 'Device ID'.

After making your selections, you'll need to indicate how the data is used similar to the Purchases section.

# What's Next

After making your privacy selections, Apple will show a preview of your app's privacy section. If you have chosen Purchases and Identifiers as described above, your privacy details should look something like this:
