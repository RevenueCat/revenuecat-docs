> The Discord integration is available to all users signed up after September '23, the legacy Starter and Pro plans, and Enterprise plans. If you're on a legacy Free plan and want to access this integration, migrate to our new pricing via your [billing settings](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/billing).

RevenueCat can deliver updates directly to you Discord server when a new event happens in your app.
