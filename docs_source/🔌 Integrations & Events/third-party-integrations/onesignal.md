> The OneSignal integration is available to all users signed up after September '23, the legacy Grow and Pro plans, and Enterprise plans. If you're on a legacy Free or Starter plan and want to access this integration, migrate to our new pricing via your [billing settings](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/billing).

OneSignal can be a useful integration tool for understanding what stage a customer is in to react accordingly. RevenueCat can automatically update user tags in OneSignal with their latest subscription status.

With our OneSignal integration, you can:

- Send an onboarding campaign to a user in a free trial
- Send a push notification to churned users and [offer them a discount](doc:ios-subscription-offers) 

With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in OneSignal, you'll be set to turbocharge your campaigns ⚡️

For every auto-renewing subscription event in RevenueCat, the following tags get added or updated on the user in OneSignal. By leaving the tag blank in the RevenueCat dashboard, you can choose to not send any value for specific tag(s).

# 1. Send device data to RevenueCat

The OneSignal integration requires some device-specific data. RevenueCat will only update users in OneSignal if the below data has been added as [Subscriber Attributes](doc:subscriber-attributes) for the user.

| Key            | Description                                                                                       | Required |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- |
| `$onesignalId` | The [OneSignal Player Id](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/users#player-id) for the user. | ✅        |

This property can be set manually, like any other [Subscriber Attributes](doc:subscriber-attributes), or through the helper method `setOnesignalID()`. 

You can listen for changes to the OneSignal Id through their SDK, and send the value to RevenueCat. If you already have OneSignal set up, you should make sure that you're also sending the OneSignal Id for users that are updating to the latest version of your app.

# 2. Send RevenueCat events into OneSignal

After you've set up the _Purchases SDK_ to send device data to RevenueCat, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the tag names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your project in the RevenueCat dashboard and find the _Integrations_ card in the left menu. Select **+ New** 

![](https://files.readme.io/c37e1b7-app.revenuecat.com_projects_85ff18c7_collaborators_1.png)

2. Choose **OneSignal** from the Integrations menu.
3. Add your **OneSignal App Id** and **OneSignal API key**.
4. Enter the tag names that RevenueCat should use, or choose the default tag names.

# 3. Testing the OneSignal integration

You can test the OneSignal integration end-to-end before going live. It's recommended that you test the integration is working properly for new users, and any existing users that may update their app to a new version.

## Make a sandbox purchase with a new user

Simulate a new user installing your app, and go through your app flow to complete a sandbox purchase.

## Check that the required device data is collected

Navigate the the [Customer View](doc:customers) for the test user that just made a purchase. Make sure that all of the required data from step 1 above is listed as attributes for the user.

## Check that the OneSignal event delivered successfully

While still on the Customer View, click into the test purchase event in the [Customer History](doc:customer-history) and make sure that the OneSignal integration event exists and was delivered successfully.
