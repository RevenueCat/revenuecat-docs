# 1. Create a RevenueCat account [here](https://app.revenuecat.com/signup)

**Personal Accounts**
Consider creating a separate RevenueCat account for each new app (aka Project).
If you ever decide to sell your app, it is easier to hand over the account itself than it is to transfer the app from within your personal RevenueCat account.

**Organizations / Enterprise**
We recommend using a shared company email address to register for RevenueCat. 
Whereas you can invite your teammates as [Collaborators](doc:collaborators) on the Project, **only the Project Owner can manage billing**.

# 2. Add a Project
Upon creating a new account, you will be asked to create your first Project.

If you need to add another Project, navigate to the [Dashboard](https://app.revenuecat.com/overview) and select **Create new project** from the Projects dropdown.
