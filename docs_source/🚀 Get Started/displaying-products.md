If you've [configured Offerings](doc:entitlements) in RevenueCat, you can control which products are shown to users without requiring an app update. Building paywalls that are dynamic and can react to different product configurations gives you maximum flexibility to make remote updates.

# Fetching Offerings

Offerings are fetched through the SDK based on their [configuration](doc:entitlements) in the RevenueCat dashboard.

The `getOfferings` method will fetch the Offerings from RevenueCat. These are pre-fetched in most cases on app launch, so the completion block to get offerings won't need to make a network request in most cases.

You must choose one Offering that is the "Current Offering" - which can easily be accessed via the `current` property of the returned offerings.

To change the current Offering, navigate to the Offerings tab for your project in the RevenueCat dashboard and click **Make current** next to the Offering you'd like to enable.

Offerings can be updated at any time, and the changes will go into effect for all users right away.


## Custom Offering identifiers
It's also possible to access other Offerings besides the "Current Offering" directly by its identifier.

# Displaying Packages

Packages help abstract platform-specific products by grouping equivalent products across iOS, Android, and web. A package is made up of three parts: identifier, type, and underlying store product.

  "data": {
    "0-0": "Identifier",
    "1-0": "Type",
    "2-0": "Product",
    "2-1": "The underlying product that is mapped to this package. Either an [SKProduct](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skproduct?language=objc) (iOS) or [SkuDetails](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/SkuDetails) (Android).",
    "1-1": "The type of the package:\n- `UNKNOWN`\n- `CUSTOM`\n- `LIFETIME`\n- `ANNUAL`\n- `SIX_MONTH`\n- `THREE_MONTH`\n- `TWO_MONTH`\n- `MONTHLY`\n- `WEEKLY`",

# Choosing which Offering to display

In practice, you may not want to display the default current Offering to every user and instead have a specific cohort that see a different Offering.

For example, displaying a higher priced Offering to users that came from [paid acquisition](doc:attribution) to help recover ad costs, or a specific Offering designed to show [iOS Subscription Offers](doc:ios-subscription-offers) when a user has [cancelled their subscription](doc:purchaserinfo#section-get-entitlement-information). 

This can be accomplished with custom Offering identifiers for each of these "cohorts".
