# What is RevenueCat?

RevenueCat provides a backend and a wrapper around StoreKit and Google Play Billing to make implementing in-app purchases and subscriptions easy. With our SDK, you can build and manage your app business on any platform without having to maintain IAP infrastructure. You can read more about [how RevenueCat fits into your app](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/where-does-revenuecat-fit-in-your-app) or you can [sign up free](https://app.revenuecat.com/signup) to start building.

# Android
## Installation

Purchases for Android (Google Play and Amazon Appstore) is available on Maven and can be included via Gradle.

  "type": "warning",
  "title": "Billing Client 5 Unsupported",
  "body": "We're working on updating our SDKs for compatibility with Billing Client 5.0. See this [community thread](https://community.revenuecat.com/tips-discussion-56/google-i-o-22-announcements-rc-product-priorities-1620?postid=5842#post5842) for updates. For now, RevenueCat is only compatible with Billing Client 4.0."
}
[/block]
## Import Purchases

You should now be able to import `Purchases`.
[block:file]
java->code_blocks/🚀 Get Started/installation/android_2.java
[/block]
## Configure Proguard

You should add `-keep class com.revenuecat.purchases.** { *; }` to your Proguard configuration.

# Amazon

## Additional Dependencies

Add a new dependency to the build.gradle apart from the regular `purchases` dependency. These new dependencies have the classes needed to use Amazon IAP:

[/block]

## Add Amazon public key

Adding support for Amazon requires adding a `.pem` public key to your project. You can configure this key by following Amazon's guide [here](https://developer.amazon.com/es/docs/in-app-purchasing/integrate-appstore-sdk.html#configure_key).

Due to some limitations, RevenueCat will only validate purchases made in production or in Live App Testing and won't validate purchases made with the Amazon App Tester.

# Next Steps

* Now that you've installed the Purchases SDK in your Android app, get started by [configuring an instance of Purchases :fa-arrow-right:](doc:getting-started-1#section-configure-purchases)
