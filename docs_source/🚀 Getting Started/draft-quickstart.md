This guide will walk you through how to get up and running with subscriptions and the Purchases SDK with only a few lines of code.

# 1. Setting up your Account
We recommend using a company account when registering for RevenueCat and setting up your app. You'll be able to invite the rest of your team as [collaborators](doc:collaborators) to your app, but only the app owner can manage billing. Note that there is not a mechanism for transferring apps between accounts, but you can change the email address of the account owner. If you intend on selling an app, you should create a separate account.

# 2. Register Your App

Navigate to the RevenueCat dashboard and [add a new app :fa-arrow-right:](https://app.revenuecat.com/apps/add) from the dropdown. A single app in RevenueCat supports all platforms.

        729,
        "#f5f7f7"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
The field "App name" is required to add your app into RevenueCat. The rest of the configuration fields can be added later. 

After registering your app, we recommend setting up [Platform Server Notifications](doc:server-notifications). This isn't required, but will speed up [webhooks](doc:webhooks) and integration delivery times and reduce lag time updating your subscribers.

  "body": "RevenueCat itself does not have separate environments for staging and production. Both sandbox and production purchases from the stores can be made from any RevenueCat app. If you do have separate apps for staging and production, you can create multiple apps in RevenueCat to mirror your setup.",
  "title": "Staging vs. Production apps"
}
[/block]
# 3. Store set up 
Before you can start using RevenueCat to fetch products, you would need to configure your products in the respective stores. See the following guides for [App Store Connect](doc:ios-products), [Google Play Console](doc:android-products), and [Stripe](doc:stripe-products) for help navigating through this process.

Service credentials need to be set up for RevenueCat to communicate with the app stores on your behalf. See our guides [iTunesConnect App Specific Shared Secret](doc:itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret ) and [Play Service Credentials](doc:creating-play-service-credentials) for more information. Note that Play service credentials can take up to 36 hours to propagate throughout Google's servers.

If you are selling iOS products, be sure to sign your 'Paid Applications Agreement' and fill out your bank and tax information in App Store Connect > Agreements, Tax, and Banking. This needs to be completed before you can test any purchases.

# 4. Configure Your Products

Once your in-app products have been configured in  [App Store Connect](doc:ios-products), [Google Play Console](doc:android-products), or [Stripe](doc:stripe-products), you'll need to copy that configuration into the RevenueCat dashboard. RevenueCat uses an Entitlements system to control access to premium features, and Offerings to manage the set of products you offer to customers. 

Entitlements are the level of access that a customer is "entitled" to after purchasing a specific product, and Offerings is a simple way for you to organize the in-app products you wish to "offer" on your paywall and configure them remotely. We **recommend** utilizing these features to simplify your code and enable you to change products without releasing an app update.

See [Configuring Products](doc:entitlements) to set up your products and then organize them into Offerings or Entitlements.

# 5. Install the Purchases SDK

*Purchases* is the RevenueCat SDK that seamlessly implements purchases and subscriptions across platforms while syncing tokens with the RevenueCat server.

If you run into issues with the SDK, see [Troubleshooting the SDKs](doc:troubleshooting-the-sdks) for guidance.

# 6. Configure the Purchases SDK
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "You can get your public SDK key from the app settings in the [dashboard](https://app.revenuecat.com/apps/).",
  "title": "Only use your public SDK key to configure Purchases"
}
[/block]
You should only configure *Purchases* once, usually on app launch. The same instance is shared throughout your app by accessing the `.shared` instance in the SDK.

See our guide on [Configuring SDK](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/configuring-sdk) for more information and best practices.

Make sure you configure *Purchases* with your public SDK key only. You can read more about the different API keys available in our [Authentication guide](doc:authentication).

When in development, we recommend enabling more verbose debug logs. For more information about these logs, see our [Debugging](doc:debugging) guide.  

If you're planning to use RevenueCat alongside your existing purchase code, check out our guide on [Observer Mode](doc:observer-mode).

# 7. Displaying Available Products

*Purchases* will automatically fetch the [configured Offerings](doc:entitlements#offerings) and retrieve the product information from Apple or Google. This means when customers launch your purchase screen, available products will already be loaded.

Below is an example of fetching Offerings. You can utilize Offerings to organize your paywall screen. See our guide on [Displaying Products](doc:displaying-products) for more information and best practices.

If fetching your [Offerings](doc:entitlements#offerings), [products](doc:entitlements#products), or available [packages](doc:entitlements#adding-packages) are empty, it's due to some configuration issue in App Store Connect or the Play Console. 

The most common reasons for this in App Store Connect are an out-of-date 'Paid Applications Agreement' or products not at least in the 'Ready To Submit' state. On Android this usually occurs when the app is not published on a closed track and a valid test user added.

You can find more info about trouble shooting this issue in our [Help Center](https://support.revenuecat.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041793174).

# 8. Make a Purchase

*Purchases* includes a simple method for facilitating purchases. The `purchasePackage` takes a package from the fetched Offering and processes the transaction with Apple or Google.

The code sample below shows the process of purchasing a package and confirming it unlocks the "your_entitlement_id" content. More detail about the `purchasePackage` method can be found in our guide on [Making Purchases](doc:making-purchases).

# 9. Get Subscription Status

*Purchases* makes it easy to check what active subscriptions the current customer has. This can be done by checking if a specific Entitlement is active, or by checking if the active Entitlements array contains a specific Entitlement ID.
If you're not using Entitlements (you probably should be!) you can check the array of active subscriptions to see what product IDs from App Store Connect or Google Play Store it contains.

You can use this method whenever you need to get the latest status, and it's safe to call this repeatedly throughout the lifecycle of your app. *Purchases* automatically caches the latest `purchaserInfo` whenever it updates â€” so in most cases, this method pulls from the cache and runs very fast.

It's typical to call this method when deciding which UI to show the user and whenever the user performs an action that requires a certain entitlement level.

# 10. Restoring Purchases

RevenueCat enables your users to restore their in-app purchases, reactivating any content that they previously purchased from the **same store account** (Apple or Google). We recommend that all apps have some way for users to trigger the restore method. Note that Apple does require a restore mechanism in the event a user loses access to their purchases (e.g: uninstalling/reinstalling the app, losing their account information, etc).

If two different [App User IDs](doc:user-ids) restore transactions from the same underlying store account (Apple or Google) the default behavior is RevenueCat will create an alias between the two App User IDs and count them as the same user going forward. See our guide on [Restoring Purchases](doc:restoring-purchases) for more information on the different configurable restore behaviors.


# (optional) Listening For Purchaser Info Updates

Since the *Purchases SDK* works seamlessly on any platform, changes to a user's purchase info may come from a variety of sources. You can respond to any changes in a customer's PurchaserInfo by conforming to an optional delegate method, `didReceivePurchaserInfo:`. This will fire whenever the *Purchases SDK* receives an updated purchaser info object from calls to `getPurchaserInfo()`, `purchasePackage()`, `purchaserProduct()`, or `restoreTransactions()`. 

PurchaserInfo updates are *not* pushed to your app from the RevenueCat backend, updates can only happen from an outbound network request to RevenueCat.

Depending on your app, it may be sufficient to ignore the delegate and simply handle changes to purchaser information the next time your app is launched or in the completion blocks of the *Purchases SDK* methods.
