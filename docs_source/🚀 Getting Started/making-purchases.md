The `purchase(package:)` completion block will contain an updated [CustomerInfo](doc:purchaserinfo) object if successful, along with some details about the transaction.

If the `error `object is present, then the purchase failed. See our guide on [Error Handling](doc:errors) for the specific error types.

The `userCancelled` boolean is a helper for handling user cancellation errors. There will still be an error object if the user cancels, but you can optionally check the boolean instead of unwrapping the error completely.
