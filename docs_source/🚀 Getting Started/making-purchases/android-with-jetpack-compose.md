Jetpack Compose is a new modern toolkit for building native UI for Android. One major difference in Jetpack Compose is the absence of `Activity`.  The `purchasePackage()` and `purchasePackageWith()` functions accept an `Activity` as the first parameter but an `Activity` is not easily accessible in a `@Composable` function.

To get around this, you can create an extension function to recursively find the nearest `Activity` from your Jetpack Compose context.

So example below shows how to check the nullable `Activity?` returned by `LocalContext.current.findActivity()` and pass it into `purchase(package:)`.
