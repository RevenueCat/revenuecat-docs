  description: Have you ever wondered how a lower priced product will perform against
    a higher priced one? Or how about whether a one week free trial converts better
    than a three day free trial? Experiments allow you to answer questions like these
    by A/B testing two offerings in your app and computing the LTV of each one based
    on the revenue generated.
