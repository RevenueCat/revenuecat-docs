## Android Installation

1. Add `RevenueCatUI`:
```groovy build.gradle
implementation 'com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-ui:7.1.0-beta.2'
```

## Overview

Our paywall templates use native code to deliver smooth, intuitive experiences to your customers when you‚Äôre ready to deliver them an Offering; and you can use our Dashboard to pick the right template and configuration to meet your needs.

To use RevenueCat Paywalls, simply:

1. [Create a Paywall](doc:creating-paywalls) on the Dashboard for the [Offering](doc:entitlements) you intend to serve to your customers

2. See [displaying paywalls](doc:displaying-paywalls) for how to display it into your app.

> üìò 
> 
> RevenueCat Paywalls are available on the following SDK versions:
> - iOS: version >= 4.26.0
> - Android: version >= 7.1.0 (beta)

## Offerings and Paywalls

You can think of a Paywall as an optional feature of your Offering. An Offering is the collection of Products which are organized into Packages to be displayed to your customers as a single "offer" across platforms. Now, with Paywalls, you can control the actual view that is used to display that "offer" in addition to controlling the products that are offered.

Therefore, you can create a unique Paywall for each of your Offerings, and can create an unlimited number of Offerings & Paywalls for each variation you want to test with Experiments.
