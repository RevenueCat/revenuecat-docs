## Trial Conversion
**Segments:** No
**Filters:** Yes
The Trial Conversion chart gives you a picture of how customers start free trials and convert into paying subscriptions. This chart is plotted on a "cohort" basis, meaning the time periods represent the date a customer was first seen, i.e. the date they first opened your app.

When a customer first launches your app, they are added to the "New Customers" number for a cohort. If they start a free trial, they contribute to the Trials column. Immediately after a trial is started, it is considered Pending as it has yet to convert, but is set to convert. Once the customer disables auto-renew, the trial is no longer Pending and is now considered Abandoned. If a user re-enables auto-renew, they will return to the Pending column. Once a trial has expired, it will be permanently counted in the Converted or Abandoned column depending on whether it converted to paid subscription or not.

Trials Conversion funnels are extremely important for understanding how well your app is monetizing. Two rates are important: the rate at which users start a trial, aka the Start Rate, and the rate that those trials convert to trials, i.e. the Conversion Rate. The Start Rate is a good way of measuring how well users are finding your trial, but Conversion Rate is the real measure of how valuable and convincing the offering is. The product of these two numbers, (Start Rate) x (Conversion Rate) is your Overall Conversion Rate which is also indicative of the overall fit of your product and pricing.

## Cohorting

This chart is cohorted by the earliest date that a customer:

1. Was "first seen", or first opened your app
2. Made their first purchase (for purchases made _outside_ of your app, like promoted purchases in the App Store)
3. Downloaded the app from the App Store (iOS)

### Example

If a customer first opened your app on April 15th, 2022, but didn't make a purchase until May 21st, 2022, they would be included in the **April 15th** cohort.

## Considerations

### ‚ùì Why doesn't the number of trial conversions match what other data sources display for the number of conversions in a time period?

Ensure you're checking against the user's cohort date, rather than the purchase event date, as described above.
