All collaborators can view customers and analytics. Only admins are able to make changes to your project's configuration.

When inviting a collaborators there are three permission levels that grant them different levels of access:
- **Admin** - Can view and make changes to project settings, including inviting other collaborators. This is usually app owners or engineers that are integrating RevenueCat.
- **Customer Support** - Can see [user activity](doc:customers), [grant promotionals](doc:promotionals), [issue refunds](doc:customer-history#section-refunding-subscriptions), and [delete customers](doc:manage-users). Cannot see any charts, overview metrics, aggregate customer lists, or most project settings (other than **Entitlements**, **Offerings**, and **Products**).
- **Read Only** - Cannot change project settings. Perfect for people that need access to revenue metrics, customer transactions, etc. but don't need access to things like API keys.
