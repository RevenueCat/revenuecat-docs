To set up products for Stripe, start by logging into the Stripe Dashboard. This guide assumes basic knowledge of Stripe and the Stripe Dashboard. For more information, visit Stripe's [documentation and guides for the Dashboard](https://stripe.com/docs/dashboard).

# Create a new Product

To create a new product, click on products in the sidebar of the Stripe Dashboard, then click **Add Product**.

The ID of the new product is a unique identifier that is automatically generated by Stripe, prefixed with `prod_`. This is the identifier that you'll need later to [setup products in RevenueCat](doc:entitlements).
