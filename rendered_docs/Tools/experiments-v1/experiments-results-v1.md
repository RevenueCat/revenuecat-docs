Within 24 hours of your experiment's launch you'll start seeing data on the Results page. RevenueCat offers experiment results through each step of the subscription journey to give you a comprehensive view of the impact of your test. You can dig into these results in a few different ways, which we'll cover below.

# Results chart

The Results chart should be your primary source for understanding how a specific metric has performed for each variant over the lifetime of your experiment.

By default you'll see your **Realized LTV per customer* for all platforms plotted daily for the lifetime of your experiment, but you can select any other experiment metric to visualize, or narrow down to a specific platform.

{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "Why Realized LTV per customer?",
  "body": "Lifetime value (LTV) is the standard success measure you should be using for pricing experiments because it captures the full revenue impact on your business. Realized LTV per customer measures the revenue you've accrued so far divided by the total customers in each variant so you understand which variant is on track to produce higher value for your business.\n\nKeep in mind that your LTV over a longer time horizon might be impacted by the renewal behavior of your customers, the mix of product durations they're on, etc."

  "title": "Data takes 24 hours to appear",
  "body": "The results refresher runs once every 24 hours.\n \nIf you're not seeing any data or are seeing unexpected results, try:\n- **Ensuring each product that is a part of the experiment has been purchased at least once**\n- **Waiting another 24 hours until the model can process more data**\n\nWhen you stop an experiment, the results will continue to be updated for the next 400 days to capture any additional subscription events, and allow you to see how your Realized LTV matures for each variant over time."

# Customer journey tables
The customer journey tables can be used to dig into and compare your results across variants. 

The customer journey for a subscription product can be complex: a "conversion" may only be the start of a trial, a single payment is only a portion of the total revenue that subscription may eventually generate, and other events like refunds and cancellations are critical to understanding how a cohort is likely to monetize over time.

To help parse your results, we've broken up experiment results into three tables:
1. **Initial conversion:** For understanding how these key early conversion rates have been influenced by your test. These metrics are frequently the strongest predictors of LTV changes in an experiment.
2. **Paid customers:** For understanding how your initial conversion trends are translating into new paying customers.
3. **Revenue:** For understanding how those two sets of changes interact with each other to yield overall impact to your business.

In addition to the results per variant that are illustrated above, you can also analyze most metrics by product as well. Click on the caret next to "All" within metrics that offer it to see the metric broken down by the individual products in your experiment. This is especially helpful when trying to understand what's driving changes in performance, and how it might impact LTV. (A more prominent yearly subscription, for example, may decrease initial conversion rate relative to a more prominent monthly option; but those fewer conversions may produce more Realized LTV per paying customer)

The results from your experiment can also be exported in this table format using the **Export data CSV** button. This will included aggregate results per variant, and per product results, for flexible analysis.

  "title": "Only new users are included in the results",
  "body": "To keep your A and B cohorts on equal footing, only new users are added to experiments. Here's an example to illustrate what can happen if existing users are added to an experiment: an existing user who is placed in a cohort might make a purchase they wouldn't otherwise make because the variant they were shown had a lower price than the default offering they previously saw. This might mean that the user made a purchase out of fear that they were missing out on a sale and wanted to lock in the price in anticipation of it going back up."

## FAQs

[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Question",
    "h-1": "Answer",
    "0-0": "What is included in the \"Other\" category in the product-level breakdown of my results?",
    "0-1": "If the customers enrolled in your experiment purchased any products that were not included in either the Control or Treatment Offering, then they will be listed in the \"Other\" category when reviewing the product-level breakdown of a metric.  \n  \nThis is to ensure that all conversions and revenue generated by these customers can be included when measuring the total revenue impact of one variant vs. another, even if that revenue was generated from other areas of the product experience (like a special offer triggered in your app).",
    "1-0": "Why do the results for one variant contain purchases of products not included in that variant's Offering?",
    "1-1": "There are many potential reasons for this, but the two most common occur when (1) there are areas of your app that serve products outside of the Current Offering returned by RevenueCat for a given customer, or (2) the offered Subscription Group on the App Store contains additional products outside of that variant's Offering.  \n  \nFor the first case, please check and confirm that all places where you serve Products in your app are relying on the Current Offering from RevenueCat to determiner what to display.  \n  \nFor the second case, we recommend creating new Subscription Groups on the App Store for each Offering so that a customer who purchases from that Offering will only have that same set of options to select from one when considering changing or canceling their subscription from Subscription Settings on iOS.",
    "2-0": "When I end an Experiment, what Offering will be served to the customers who were enrolled in that Experiment?",
    "2-1": "When an Experiment is ended, all customers previously enrolled in it will be served the Default Offering the next time they reach a paywall in your app.",
    "3-0": "How can I review the individual customers who were enrolled in my experiment?",
    "3-1": "When using the Get or Create Subscriber endpoint you'll be able to see if an individual subscriber was enrolled in an experiment, and which variant they were assigned to, and can then pass that fact to other destinations like an analytics provider like Amplitude & Mixpanel, or your own internal database.",
    "4-0": "How can I review the individual transactions that have occurred in my experiment?",
    "4-1": "Our [Scheduled Data Exports](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/scheduled-data-exports) include the experiment enrollment of each subscriber in the reported transactions, and by subscribing to them you can receive daily exports of all of your transactions to analyze the experiment results further."
