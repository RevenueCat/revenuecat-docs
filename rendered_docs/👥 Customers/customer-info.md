## Get User Information

The <<glossary:CustomerInfo>> object contains all of the purchase and subscription data available about the user. This object is updated whenever a purchase or restore occurs and periodically throughout the lifecycle of your app. The latest information can always be retrieved by calling `getCustomerInfo()`:

```swift 
Purchases.shared.getCustomerInfo { (customerInfo, error) in
    // access latest customerInfo
}
```
```objectivec 
[[RCPurchases sharedPurchases] customerInfoWithCompletion:^(RCCustomerInfo * customerInfo, NSError * error) {
     // access latest customerInfo
}];
```
```kotlin 
Purchases.sharedInstance.getCustomerInfo({ error -> /* Optional error handling */ }) { customerInfo ->
  // access latest customerInfo
}
```
```java 
Purchases.getSharedInstance().getCustomerInfo(new ReceiveCustomerInfoCallback() {
  @Override
  public void onReceived(@NonNull CustomerInfo customerInfo) {
    // access latest customerInfo
  }
  
  @Override
  public void onError(@NonNull PurchasesError error) {

  }
});
```
```javascript Flutter
try {
  CustomerInfo customerInfo = await Purchases.getCustomerInfo();
  // access latest customerInfo
} on PlatformException catch (e) {
  // Error fetching customer info
}
```
```javascript React Native
try {
  const customerInfo = await Purchases.getCustomerInfo();
  // access latest customerInfo
} catch (e) {
 // Error fetching customer info
}
```
```javascript Cordova
Purchases.getCustomerInfo(
  customerInfo => {
     // access latest customerInfo
  },
  error => {
    // Error fetching customer info
  }
);
```
```csharp Unity
var purchases = GetComponent<Purchases>();
purchases.GetCustomerInfo((customerInfo, error) =>
{
  // access latest customerInfo
});
```

It's safe to call `getCustomerInfo()` frequently throughout your app. Since the SDK updates and caches the latest <<glossary:CustomerInfo>> when the app becomes active, the completion block won't need to make a network request in most cases. 

> ðŸ“˜ Working with the cache
> 
> The SDK caches the user's subscription information to reduce your app's reliance on the network. Users who unlock entitlements will be able to access them even without an internet connection. The SDK will update the cache if it's older than 5 minutes, but only if you call `getCustomerInfo()`, make a purchase, or restore purchases, so it's a good idea to call `getCustomerInfo()` any time a user accesses premium content.

The `CustomerInfo` object gives you access to the following information about a user:

## Checking If A User Is Subscribed

The subscription status for a user can easily be determined with the `CustomerInfo` and `EntitlementInfo` objects.

For most apps that only have one entitlement, the `isActive` status can be quickly checked for your entitlement ID. 

```swift 
if customerInfo.entitlements[<your_entitlement_id>]?.isActive == true {
  // user has access to "your_entitlement_id"                
}
```
```objectivec 
if (customerInfo.entitlements[@<your_entitlement_id>].isActive) {
  // user has access to "your_entitlement_id"
}
```
```kotlin 
if (customerInfo.entitlements[<your_entitlement_id>]?.isActive == true) {
	// user has access to "your_entitlement_id"                
}
```
```java 
if (customerInfo.getEntitlements().get(<your_entitlement_id>).isActive()) {
	// user has access to "your_entitlement_id"
}
```
```javascript Flutter
if (customerInfo.entitlements.all[<my_entitlement_identifier>].isActive) {
  // Grant user "pro" access
}
```
```javascript React Native
if(typeof customerInfo.entitlements.active[<my_entitlement_identifier>] !== "undefined") {
  // Grant user "pro" access
}
```
```javascript Cordova
if(typeof customerInfo.entitlements.active[<my_entitlement_identifier>] !== "undefined") {
  // Grant user "pro" access
}
```
```csharp Unity
if (customerInfo.Entitlements.Active.ContainsKey(<my_entitlement_identifier>)) {
  // Unlock that great "pro" content
}
```

If your app has multiple entitlements and you need to check if a user is subscribed to at least one you can also check for the entitlement Id in the `active` dictionary of `EntitlementInfo` objects.

```swift 
if !customerInfo.entitlements.active.isEmpty {
    //user has access to some entitlement
}
```
```objectivec 
if ([customerInfo.entitlements.active count] > 0) {
    //user has access to some entitlement
}
```
```kotlin 
if (customerInfo.entitlements.active.isNotEmpty()) {
  //user has access to some entitlement
}
```
```java 
if (!customerInfo.getEntitlements().getActive().isEmpty()) {
	//user has access to some entitlement
}
```
```javascript Flutter
if (customerInfo.entitlements.active.isNotEmpty) {
  //user has access to some entitlement
}
```
```javascript React Native
if (Object.entries(customerInfo.entitlements.active).length) {
  //user has access to some entitlement
}
```
```javascript Cordova
if (Object.entries(customerInfo.entitlements.active).length) {
  //user has access to some entitlement
}
```
```csharp Unity
if (customerInfo.Entitlements.Active.Count != 0) {
    //user has access to some entitlement
}
```

It's important to note that <<glossary:CustomerInfo>> will be empty if no purchases have been made and no transactions have been synced. This means that entitlements may not exist in CustomerInfo even if they have been set up in the RevenueCat dashboard.

## Listening For CustomerInfo Updates

Since _Purchases_ SDK works seamlessly on any platform, a user's <<glossary:CustomerInfo>> may change from a variety of sources. You can respond to any changes in CustomerInfo by conforming to an optional delegate method, `purchases:receivedUpdated:`. This will fire whenever we receive a _change_ in CustomerInfo _on the current device_ and you should expect it to be called at launch and throughout the life of the app.

CustomerInfo updates are not pushed to your app from the RevenueCat backend, updates can only happen from an outbound network request to RevenueCat.

Depending on your app, it may be sufficient to ignore the delegate and simply handle changes to customer information the next time your app is launched. Or throughout your app as you request new `CustomerInfo` objects.

```swift 
// Additional configure setup
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
  
    Purchases.logLevel = .debug
    Purchases.configure(withAPIKey: <public_sdk_key>)
    Purchases.shared.delegate = self // make sure to set this after calling configure
}

extension AppDelegate: PurchasesDelegate {
    func purchases(_ purchases: Purchases, receivedUpdated customerInfo: Purchases.CustomerInfo) {
        // handle any changes to customerInfo
    }
}
```
```objectivec 
- (void)purchases:(nonnull RCPurchases *)purchases receivedUpdatedCustomerInfo:(nonnull RCCustomerInfo *)customerInfo {
    // handle any changes to customerInfo
}
```
```kotlin 
class UpsellActivity : AppCompatActivity(), UpdatedCustomerInfoListener {
  override fun onReceived(customerInfo: CustomerInfo) {
    // handle any changes to customerInfo
  }
  
  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    Purchases.sharedInstance.updatedCustomerInfoListener = this
  }   
}
```
```java 
public class UpsellActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements UpdatedCustomerInfoListener {
  @Override public void onReceived(CustomerInfo customerInfo) {
    // handle any changes to customerInfo
  } 
  
  @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
		Purchases.getSharedInstance().setUpdatedCustomerInfoListener(this);
  }   
}
```
```javascript Flutter
Purchases.addCustomerInfoUpdateListener((info) {
	// handle any changes to customerInfo
});
```
```javascript React Native
Purchases.addCustomerInfoUpdateListener((info) => {
	// handle any changes to customerInfo
});
```
```javascript Cordova
window.addEventListener("onCustomerInfoUpdated", (info) => {
	// handle any changes to customerInfo
});
```
```csharp Unity
public class PurchasesListener : Purchases.UpdatedCustomerInfoListener
{
    public override void CustomerInfoReceived(Purchases.CustomerInfo customerInfo)
    {
        // handle any changes to CustomerInfo
    }
}
```

## Web Apps

If you also have a web app, or need to get a user's subscription status from outside of the _Purchases SDK_, you should use the REST API. You can read the full API reference [here](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference).

```curl 
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.revenuecat.com/v1/subscribers/app_user_id \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer PUBLIC_API_KEY'
```

## Handling Refunds

RevenueCat can handle refunds across all platforms for both subscription and non-subscription products. As soon as RevenueCat detects a refund, the <<glossary:CustomerInfo>> will be updated to reflect the correct entitlement status - no action required on your part! If you have questions about refunds, take a look at our [community article](https://community.revenuecat.com/general-questions-7/how-do-i-issue-a-refund-115) covering the topic.

> ðŸ“˜ Granting refunds for Google Play subscriptions
> 
> In order for RevenueCat to detect refunds for Google Play, you must grant the refund via the [RevenueCat dashboard](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/customer-history#refunding-purchases) or [API](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference#revoke-a-google-subscription).
> 
> Refunds granted via the Google Play Console are not properly detected as refunds in RevenueCat.
