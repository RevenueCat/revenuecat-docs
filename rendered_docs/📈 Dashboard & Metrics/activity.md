The Activity table is a real-time activity feed of transactions being recorded for your apps. Each row represents a unique transaction. A transaction can be a trial start, trial conversion, renewal, or regular purchase. 

For example, if user123 starts a trial then converts to a paid subscription they will have two rows in the Activity table.
