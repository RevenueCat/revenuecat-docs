## Active Trials Movement
**Segments:** No
**Filters:** Yes
The Active Trials Movement chart breaks down the inputs to the Active Trials chart and gives you a picture of how your active trial base is evolving.

New Trials are trials started during the period. Expired Trials are the trials that completed during the period. The difference between these two numbers is the Movement and it tells you if your trial base is growing or shrinking.

Understanding the dynamics of your trial base is important for understanding leading indicators of the growth of your business.
