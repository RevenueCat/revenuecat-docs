## Initial Conversion
**Segments:** Yes
**Filters:** Yes
The Initial Conversion chart shows what proportion of new customers start any subscription (including trial) or make any purchase.

The initial conversion rate is a good indicator of how effective your app is at acquiring the right kind of customers and messaging the value proposition of your premium products, including the effectiveness of your paywall.

For apps that exclusively rely on products with trials, the initial conversion rate is equal to the trial start rate. For apps that offer no trials at all, the initial conversion rate is equal to the conversion rate to paying (because there are no subscribers that don't pay).

## Cohorting

This chart is cohorted by the earliest date that a customer:

1. Was "first seen", or first opened your app
2. Made their first purchase (for purchases made _outside_ of your app, like promoted purchases in the App Store)
3. Downloaded the app from the App Store (iOS)

### Example

If a customer first opened your app on April 15th, 2022, but didn't make a purchase until May 21st, 2022, they would be included in the **April 15th** cohort.

## Considerations

### ‚ùì Why doesn't the value of Initial Conversions match what other data sources display for the number of conversions in a time period?

Ensure you're checking against the user's cohort date, rather than the purchase event date, as described above.
