You can override the current offering that displays in your app on a per-user basis by selecting a different offering in the **Current Offering** card. This can be useful for:

- Testing your dynamic paywall in sandbox without affecting your production app by changing the current offering for your own sandbox user. This is especially important for testing your offerings for [Experiments](doc:experiments-beta).
- Overriding the current offering for a customer in order to give them access to a specific in-app purchase that isn't otherwise available to the rest of your user base, as in the case of offering discounts in a customer support setting.

In the card, you'll see the current offering for the user:
