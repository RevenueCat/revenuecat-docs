The Active Subscriptions chart shows the number of unexpired, paid subscriptions at the end of each period charted. For the current period, the number indicated is the current active subscriptions. Subscriptions that have auto-renew disabled are still counted in Active Subscriptions.  

Note that it is possible for a single user to start multiple subscriptions in the same period, if for example they start a trial for a monthly subscription then switch to an annual subscription.

This chart is useful for understanding the number of individual, recurring relationships you are currently serving and is a proxy for the size of the business and is powerful when combined with [filters and segments](doc:charts#section-filters-and-segments) to understand what is driving subscriptions.
