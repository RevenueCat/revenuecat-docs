## Refund Rate
**Segments:** Yes
**Filters:** Yes
The Refund Rate chart shows the number of transactions (new subscriptions and renewals) in each time period and what proportion of these transactions was refunded. Trial start transactions are excluded from the Refund Rate chart, given that they have no revenue and canâ€™t be refunded.

The Refund Rate is an important indicator whether your customers are getting the value they expected when they started their subscription.
