The 'New Customers' card displays the number of App User IDs created in the past 28 days. Multiple App User IDs aliased together will be counted as 1 New Customer.

{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "You should expect the New Customer count in RevenueCat to be different than the download numbers provided by the respective store. However, if things seem drastically off, make sure you're [identifying users](doc:user-ids) correctly in RevenueCat."

The 'Active Users' card displays the number of App User IDs that have communicated with RevenueCat in the past 28 days. Active users should be higher than 'New Customers' if your app is retaining users and they keep coming back after 28 days. Multiple App User IDs aliased together will be counted as 1 active user.

You can hover over the icon in the bottom right corner of the card to see how recently the data within the card has been updated. For most customers, subscription metrics will be updated in real-time, but New Customer and Active Users may be cached for 1-2 hours. For some larger customers, for performance reasons, subscription metrics may be cached for 1-2 hours as well.

Click on the "Explore" icon in the top right corner of the card to see the corresponding chart to better understand your performance.

You can also click on "Filter" just above your Overview cards to filter your metrics by Project.

# Sandbox Data

The sandbox data toggle will change the Overview metrics to report from sandbox purchases or production purchases. There's no concept of a sandbox or production *user* in RevenueCat, since the same App User Id can have both production and sandbox receipts. Because of this, **the 'View sandbox data' toggle will not affect 'Installs' or 'Active User' cards**.
