RevenueCat does not require server notifications from Google Play, however doing so can speed up webhook and integration delivery times and reduce lag time for [Charts](doc:charts).

# Setup Instructions

[Google real-time developer notifications](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/realtime_developer_notifications) can be set up directly from the RevenueCat dashboard. This will set up a new subscriber to Google's subscription status notifications, which will not affect any existing subscribers you may already have in place.

1. **Ensure Google Cloud Pub/Sub is enabled for your project**. You can enable it [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=pubsub).

      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
8. Click the **Copy** button to copy the topic ID to your clipboard.
9. Open the Google Play Console for your app and navigate to **Monetization setup**.
10. In the "Real-time developer notifications" section, paste in your topic ID and then click on **Save**

If you don't see any errors, your real-time developer notifications should be ready to go.

# Send Test Notification

There is an option in Google Play to send a test notification. This is a great way to verify that Google Pub/Sub is correctly connected to your RevenueCat account.

Click the "Send test notification" button under the "Topic name" in the "Monetization setup" section

    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/540cd15-Screen_Shot_2022-12-16_at_9.52.55_AM.png",
        "Screen Shot 2022-12-16 at 9.52.55 AM.png",
        1282,
        492,
        "#000000"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Once that test notification is sent, you can go back to your app config on the RevenueCat dashboard where you connected to Google to enable real-time notifications. If the configuration was successful, you should see a "Last received" label with a recent timestamp.
