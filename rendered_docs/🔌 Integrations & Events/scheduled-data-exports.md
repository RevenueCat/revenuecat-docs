> Scheduled data exports are available to all users signed up after September '23, the legacy Grow and Pro plans, and Enterprise plans. If you're on a legacy Free or Starter plan and want to access this integration, migrate to our new pricing via your [billing settings](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/billing).

RevenueCat can automatically send data deliveries of all of your apps' transaction data to various cloud storage providers. These are in the form of [gzip compressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) .csv files delivered daily.

## A note on transaction data

All transaction data is based on the store receipts that RevenueCat has received. Receipts often have inconsistencies and quirks which may need to be considered. For example:

- The expiration date of a purchase can be before the purchase date. This is Google's way of invalidating a transaction, for example when Google is unable to bill a user some time after a subscription renews. This doesn’t occur on iOS.
- If you migrated to RevenueCat, Google subscriptions that were expired for more then 60 days before being migrated will not have transaction histories in export files.
- Apple and Google do not provide the transaction price directly, so we must rely on historical data for the products that we have. This isn’t 100% accurate in cases where the prices were changed or receipts were imported.
- Renewal numbers start at 1, even for trials. Trial conversions increase the renewal number.
- Data is pulled from a snapshot of the current receipt state, this means that the same transaction can be different from one delivery to another if something changed, e.g.refunds, and billing issues. You should recompute metrics for past time periods periodically to take these changes into account.

We try to normalize or at least annotate these quirks as much as possible, but by and large we consider receipts as the sources of truth, so any inconsistencies in the transaction data can always be traced back to the receipt

# Sample queries for RevenueCat measures

You can use the following sample queries (written in Postgresql) as starting points for reproducing common RevenueCat measures.

```pgsql Active Trials
-- Active Trials as of your [targeted_date]

SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  [revenuecat_data_table]
WHERE date(effective_end_time) > [targeted_date]
  AND date(start_time) <= [targeted_date]
  AND is_trial_period = 'true'
  AND (effective_end_time IS NULL OR DATE_DIFF('s', start_time, effective_end_time)::float > 0)
  AND ownership_type != 'FAMILY_SHARED'
  AND store != 'promotional'
  AND is_sandbox != 'true'

-- The RevenueCat Active Trials chart excludes
-- promotional transactions and transactions resulting from family sharing
-- since they do not reflect auto-renewing future payments.
```
```pgsql Active Subscriptions
-- Active Subscriptions as of your [targeted_date]

SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  [revenuecat_data_table]
WHERE date(effective_end_time) > [targeted_date]
  AND date(start_time) <= [targeted_date]
  AND is_trial_period = 'false'
  AND (effective_end_time IS NULL OR DATE_DIFF('s', start_time, effective_end_time)::float > 0)
  AND ownership_type != 'FAMILY_SHARED'
  AND store != 'promotional'
  AND is_sandbox != 'true'

-- The RevenueCat Active Subscriptions chart excludes trials,
-- promotional transactions, and transactions resulting from family sharing
-- since they do not reflect auto-renewing future payments.
```
```pgsql Revenue
-- Revenue generated on [targeted_date]

SELECT
  SUM(price_in_usd) as revenue
FROM
  [revenuecat_data_table]
WHERE date(start_time) = [targeted_date]
  AND is_trial_period = 'false'
  AND (effective_end_time IS NULL OR DATE_DIFF('s', start_time, effective_end_time)::float > 0)
  AND ownership_type != 'FAMILY_SHARED'
  AND store != 'promotional'
  AND is_sandbox != 'true'

-- Transactions which are refunded can be identified through the refunded_at field.
-- Once refunded, price_in_usd will be set to $0, so revenue will always be net of refunds.
```

# Sample queries for customized measures

Scheduled Data Exports are a powerful way to add your own customizations on top of the core measures provided by RevenueCat. Check out the following sample queries (written in Postgresql) for some ideas.

```pgsql Active Subs by Custom Attribute
-- How many Active Subscriptions do I have with a given custom attribute value?

  you.custom_attribute_key, COUNT(*)

  [revenuecat_data_table] rc

    ON you.rc_original_app_user_id = rc.rc_original_app_user_id
  
WHERE date(rc.effective_end_time) > [targeted_date]
  AND date(rc.start_time) <= [targeted_date]
  AND rc.is_trial_period = 'false'
  AND (rc.effective_end_time IS NULL OR DATE_DIFF('s', rc.start_time, rc.effective_end_time)::float > 0)
  AND rc.ownership_type != 'FAMILY_SHARED'
  AND rc.store != 'promotional'
  AND rc.is_sandbox <> 'true'
  GROUP BY you.custom_attribute_key
```
```pgsql Weekly Revenue (starting Monday)

  AND is_trial_period = 'false'
  AND (effective_end_time IS NULL OR DATE_DIFF('s', start_time, effective_end_time)::float > 0)
  AND ownership_type != 'FAMILY_SHARED'
  AND store != 'promotional'
  AND is_sandbox != 'true'
  GROUP BY week
```
```pgsql Realized LTV Segments
-- What is my Realized LTV of each monthly subscription cohort, segmented by whether they were offered a trial?

  COUNT() as subscriptions,
  SUM(realized_ltv) as realized_ltv,
  SUM(realized_ltv) / COUNT() as realized_ltv_per_subscription

  subscriptions
```
```pgsql Active Trials by Grace Period Status

  GROUP BY period_type
```
