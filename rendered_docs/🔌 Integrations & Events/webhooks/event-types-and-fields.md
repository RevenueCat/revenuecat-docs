> To get the RevenueCat event `id` from a Subscription Lifecycle webhook, simply make an API call to our GET `/subscribers`endpoint with the `app_user_id` after receiving the webhook and look for the latest purchase in the [subscription](https://www.revenuecat.com/reference/subscribers#the-subscription-object)/[non-subscription](https://www.revenuecat.com/reference/subscribers#the-non-subscription-object) object.

> 📘 Determine trial and subscription duration
> 
> To get a trial or subscription's duration from a webhook, you can subtract purchased_at_ms from expiration_at_ms and you will get the duration of the trial in milliseconds.
