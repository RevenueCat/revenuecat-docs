With our Apple Search Ads integration you can:
* Continue to follow your campaign's install base for months to understand the long-tail revenue generated from subscriptions, even without an app open.
* Filter and segment RevenueCat charts by Apple Search Ads campaigns or ad groups.

# 1. Send attribution data to RevenueCat 

The *Purchases SDK* can automatically collect Apple Search Ads attribution data as long as you import the iAd framework to your Xcode project and set `automaticAttributionCollection = true`.

```swift
import iAd
...
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
		
    Purchases.automaticAppleSearchAdsAttributionCollection = true
    Purchases.configure(withAPIKey: "public_sdk_key", appUserID: "my_app_user_id")
    
    return true
}
```
```objectivec
#import <iAd/iAd.h>
... 
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application 
  didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  
  RCPurchases.automaticAppleSearchAdsAttributionCollection = YES;
  [RCPurchases configureWithAPIKey:@"public_sdk_key" appUserID:@"my_app_user_id"];

}
```
Don't forget to import the iAd framework to your XCode project.

# 2. View attribution data in RevenueCat

After the *Purchases SDK* has collected attribution for some users, you'll be able to segment and view charts for those conversions.

## Choose conversion level
In the 'Select Segment' dropdown choose *Apple search ads group* or *Apple search ads campaign* from the Segment section.
