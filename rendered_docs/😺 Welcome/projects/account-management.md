# Account Security & 2FA

Read more about account security and two-factor authentication in our [Account Security](doc:security) guide.

# Update your email or name

You can change your account email and name from your [account settings](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/account) in the dashboard.

## How does billing work?

RevenueCat bills based on **Monthly Tracked Revenue**, or MTR, for each plan. MTR is different than Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, and includes the revenue from all purchases and renewals including non-subscription products. You can see your account's current MTR [here](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/billing).

## Tax & VAT details

Please reach out to [RevenueCat Support](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/support) if you need Tax IDs or VAT information added to your invoices. 

> 📘 VAT updates apply to future invoices only
> 
> RevenueCat Support **cannot** add tax IDs and VAT information to invoices that have already been sent, and any added tax IDs and VAT information will only apply to **future** invoices.

# Delete your account

> ❗️ 
> 
> To delete your RevenueCat account, you'll first need to delete **all of your [Projects](doc:projects)**. Note that deleting any active Projects will prevent users from accessing their purchases via the RevenueCat SDK but **will not** cancel any of your customer's active subscriptions.
> 
> Once your projects have been deleted, reach out to RevenueCat Support via the dashboard [Contact Us](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/support) form in your account settings and request your account to be deleted.
