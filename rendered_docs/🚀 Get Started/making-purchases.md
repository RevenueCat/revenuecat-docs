The SDK has a simple method, `purchase(package:)`, that takes a package from the fetched Offering and purchases the underlying product with Apple, Google, or Amazon. 
```swift
Purchases.shared.purchase(package: package) { (transaction, customerInfo, error, userCancelled) in
  if customerInfo.entitlements["your_entitlement_id"]?.isActive == true {
    // Unlock that great "pro" content              
  }
}
```
```objectivec
[[RCPurchases sharedPurchases] purchasePackage:package withCompletion:^(RCStoreTransaction *transaction, RCCustomerInfo *customerInfo, NSError *error, BOOL cancelled) {
  if (customerInfo.entitlements[@"your_entitlement_id"].isActive) {
    // Unlock that great "pro" content
  }
}];
```
```kotlin
Purchases.sharedInstance.purchasePackageWith(
  this,
  aPackage,
  onError = { error, userCancelled -> /* No purchase */ },
  onSuccess = { product, customerInfo ->
    if (customerInfo.entitlements["my_entitlement_identifier"]?.isActive == true) {
    // Unlock that great "pro" content
  }
})
```
```java
Purchases.getSharedInstance().purchasePackage(
    this,
    aPackage,
    new MakePurchaseListener() {
        @Override
        public void onCompleted(@NonNull Purchase purchase, @NonNull CustomerInfo customerInfo) {
            if (customerInfo.getEntitlements().get("my_entitlement_identifier").isActive()) {
              // Unlock that great "pro" content
            }
        }

        @Override
        public void onError(@NonNull PurchasesError error, Boolean userCancelled) {
          // No purchase
        }
    }
);
```
```javascript
Purchases.purchasePackage(package, ({ productIdentifier, customerInfo }) => {
    if (typeof customerInfo.entitlements.active.my_entitlement_identifier !== "undefined") {
      // Unlock that great "pro" content
    }
  },
  ({error, userCancelled}) => {
    // Error making purchase
  }
);

// Note: if you are using purchaseProduct to purchase Android In-app products, an optional third parameter needs to be provided when calling purchaseProduct. You can use the package system to avoid this.

Purchases.purchaseProduct("product_id", ({ productIdentifier, customerInfo }) => {
}, ({error, userCancelled}) => {
    // Error making purchase
}, null, Purchases.PURCHASE_TYPE.INAPP);
```
```csharp
Purchases purchases = GetComponent<Purchases>();
purchases.PurchasePackage(package, (productIdentifier, customerInfo, userCancelled, error) =>
{
  if (customerInfo.Entitlements.Active.ContainsKey("my_entitlement_identifier")) {
    // Unlock that great "pro" content
  }
});
```
The `purchase(package:)` completion block will contain an updated [CustomerInfo](doc:purchaserinfo) object if successful, along with some details about the transaction.

If the `error `object is present, then the purchase failed. See our guide on [Error Handling](doc:errors) for the specific error types.

The `userCancelled` boolean is a helper for handling user cancellation errors. There will still be an error object if the user cancels, but you can optionally check the boolean instead of unwrapping the error completely.
