To set up products for Android devices, start by logging into Google Play Console. Google Play Console is Google's central hub for managing app releases, testing, in-app purchases, and more. 

This guide assumes basic knowledge of Google Play Console, as well as having an app set up and ready for adding in-app purchases. For more information, visit [Google's documentation and guides for Google Play Console](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/?hl=en#topic=3450769).

# Create an In-App Product or Subscription

> ðŸ“˜ 
> 
> You'll need to have an APK uploaded before you can create in-app products. Check out our guide on [sandbox testing on Android](doc:google-play-store) for details on how to upload an APK and roll out a release on a closed test track.

To create an in-app product or subscription, go to Google Play Console's 'All Applications' page and select your app from the list.

In the sidebar, select the **Products** dropdown. Depending on your in-app product type, you will either choose **In-app products** or **Subscriptions**.

After clicking Create, provide a couple pieces of metadata to Google:

| Metadata   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Product ID | The product ID is a unique alphanumeric ID that is used for accessing your product in development and syncing with RevenueCat. After you use a Product ID for one product in Google Play Console, **it canâ€™t be used again across any of your apps, even if the product is deleted**. |
| Name       | A short name of the item, up to 55 characters. This will be displayed on your Google Play Store listing.                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Tips for creating robust product IDs

After you use a Product ID for one product in Google Play Console, **it canâ€™t be used again across any of your apps, even if the product is deleted**. It helps to be a little organized here from the beginning - we recommend using a consistent naming scheme across all of your product identifiers such as:

> **`<app>_<entitlement>_<version>`** 

- **app:** Some prefix that will be unique to your app, since the same product Id cannot but used in any future apps you create. 
- **entitlement**: A name for what the product provides access to, e.g., "premium"
- **version**: A version number


For example, using this format the identifier for your first product that grants access to a "premium" subscription would be:

> `rc_premium_v1`

## Create a base plan

For subscription products, you'll need to add a base plan. Base plans define a billing period, price, and renewal type for purchasing your subscription. Customers never purchase a subscription product directly, they always purchase a base plan of a subscription.

Click "Add base plan" and fill out the associated fields. Make sure to set a price, and click "Activate". Since subscription products can only have a single base plan with the same duration and renewal type, a good way to name base plans could be `<duration>_<renewaltype>`, eg. `annual_autorenewing`.

## (Optional) Create an offer

If you wish to create an offer for your base plan, you can do so from the subscription page by clicking "Add offer". Offers can be free trials, discounts, or simply special price setups that apply when a customer first purchases a subscription.

You can then select a product ID, eligibility, and offer phases.

## Making Subscriptions Editable, InAppProduct API

**RevenueCat does not use the InAppProduct API for subscriptions.** You are safe to make subscriptions editable, **unless** you are manually using this API outside of RevenueCat.

This is related to this notice:

If you are relying solely on RevenueCat for your subscriptions, you can safely select "Make editable".
