# What is RevenueCat?

RevenueCat provides a backend and a wrapper around StoreKit and Google Play Billing to make implementing in-app purchases and subscriptions easy. With our SDK, you can build and manage your app business on any platform without having to maintain IAP infrastructure. You can read more about [how RevenueCat fits into your app](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/where-does-revenuecat-fit-in-your-app/) or you can [sign up free](https://app.revenuecat.com/signup) to start building.

# Requirements

Xcode 13.2.0+
Minimum target: iOS 11.0+

# Installation

RevenueCat for iOS can be installed either via [CocoaPods](doc:ios#section-install-via-cocoapods), [Carthage](ios#section-install-via-carthage), or [Swift Package Manager](doc:ios#section-install-via-swift-package-manager).

## Install via Swift Package Manager

You can use Swift Package Manager to add RevenueCat to your Xcode project. Select `File Â» Add Packages... ` and enter the repository URL of the `https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios.git` into the search bar (top right). Set the Dependency Rule to `Up to next major`, and the version number to `4.0.0 < 5.0.0`. Check `RevenueCat` when a prompt for "Choose Package Products for purchases-ios" appears. Finally, choose the target where you want to use it. 

The library should have been added to the Swift Package Dependencies section and you should be able to import it now.

## Install via CocoaPods

To always use the latest release, add the following to your Podfile:
```ruby Podfile
pod 'RevenueCat'
```
Alternatively, pin to a specific minor version:
```ruby 
pod 'RevenueCat', '~> 4.15'
```
And then run:
```ruby Terminal
pod install
```
This will add `RevenueCat.framework` to your workspace.


## Install via Carthage

To always use the latest release, add the following to your Cartfile:
```text Cartfile
github "revenuecat/purchases-ios"
```
Alternatively, pin to a specific minor version:
```text 
github "revenuecat/purchases-ios" ~> 4.15.0
```
### Carthage with XCFrameworks

If you're using Carthage version >= 0.37, you can use RevenueCat as an XCFramework instead of a Universal Framework. This makes setup easier, since you don't have to set up build phases at all. 
To use XCFrameworks with Carthage, you need to pass in `--use-xcframeworks`.
```shell Terminal
carthage update --use-xcframeworks
```
More information on using XCFrameworks with Carthage is available at https://github.com/carthage/Carthage/#building-platform-independent-xcframeworks-xcode-12-and-above

  "type": "warning",
  "body": "Under certain configurations, when debugging your app, using `po` to print objects to the console might result in an error `\"Couldn't IRGen Expression\"`. If you run into this, one workaround is to add a single, empty Objective-C file to your project, and create a bridging header. There's more information on this issue [here](https://steipete.com/posts/couldnt-irgen-expression/)"
}
[/block]
### Carthage with regular frameworks

Run:
```text 
carthage update
```
# Import the SDK

{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "Objective-C Only Projects",
  "body": "You may need to add an empty Swift file and a bridging header to your project before compiling."
}
[/block]
You should now be able to `import RevenueCat`.
```swift 
import RevenueCat
```
```objectivec 
@import RevenueCat;

// or

#import "Purchases.h"
```

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "Enable In-App Purchase capability for your project",
  "body": "Don't forget to enable the In-App Purchase capability for your project under `Project Target -> Capabilities -> In-App Purchase`"
}
