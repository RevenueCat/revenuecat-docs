In order to use [RevenueCat Checkout](doc:revenuecat-checkout) or manually send Stripe purchases to RevenueCat from your own paywall, you'll need to connect your Stripe account to RevenueCat, create products, and attach those products to your offerings and entitlements.

# Connecting with Stripe

  "title": "Project Owner must connect with Stripe",
  "body": "Only the **owner** of the RevenueCat Project can connect a Stripe account for their apps - no collaborators will be able to add or remove a Stripe connection."
}
[/block]
Log into [RevenueCat](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/account) and click the Connect with Stripe button in your account settings. Follow the instructions to either create a new account with Stripe, or sign in with your existing one.

**Stripe Permissions**
RevenueCat requests only **read** access by default. If you enable RevenueCat Pay, RevenueCat will also request **write** access from Stripe in order to make new purchases via the hosted paywall.

You will still maintain full control of your Stripe account via the Stripe dashboard.

# Create a Stripe App

*If you already have a Stripe app set up in your Project, you can skip this section.*

In your [Project](doc:projects) settings, click Apps, then click '+ New'.

Select Stripe as the platform, and give the app a name before clicking 'Save changes'.

# Configuring Stripe Products and Plans

Create your Stripe product(s) using their [billing dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions/products). 

In Stripe, a *product* can have multiple *pricing plans*. These are useful if you want to offer different price points for the same product and work similar to *offerings* and *products* in RevenueCat.

You can read more about products and plans in their [official documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/quickstart).

  "type": "warning",
  "title": "Important",
  "body": "RevenueCat only supports **per unit** and **recurring quantity** subscription plans. Metered usage and tiers are currently not supported."
}
[/block]
# Add Products to RevenueCat Offerings and Entitlements

Add your Stripe products to your project's [entitlements](doc:entitlements) to easily group the products for your app. RevenueCat will send Stripe subscriptions to your app the same way we do for the other app stores. 
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "In order for Stripe subscriptions to unlock [entitlements](doc:entitlements), you must set a Product Identifier in the desired Offering to match a Stripe **Product ID** exactly.",
  "title": "Product Identifier should be a Stripe Product ID"
}
[/block]
# What's next?

- If you're setting up a RevenueCat Checkout hosted paywall, continue the integration by following our [RevenueCat Checkout](doc:revenuecat-checkout) guide.
- If you're going to be handling the Stripe payment flow manually with a custom paywall, continue with our [manual integration guide](doc:stripe).
