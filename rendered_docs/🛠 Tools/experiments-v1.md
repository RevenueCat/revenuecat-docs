Have you ever wondered how a lower-priced product will perform against a higher-priced one? Or how about whether a one-week free trial converts better than a three-day free trial? Experiments allow you to answer questions like these by A/B testing two offerings in your app and analyzing the full subscription lifecycle to understand which variant is producing more value for your business.

Plus, by attaching metadata to your offerings and programming your paywall to be responsive to it, you can remotely test any aspect of your paywall.
