# Debugging

RevenueCat's SDK will log important information and errors to help you understand what is going on behind the scenes. You can enable more detailed debug logs with the `debugLogsEnabled` flag. You can set this immediately in your app while testing, **before you configure Purchases**.
```swift
Purchases.logLevel = .debug
Purchases.configure(withAPIKey: "public_sdk_key", appUserID: "my_app_user_id")
```
```objectivec
RCPurchases.logLevel = RCLogLevelDebug;
[RCPurchases configureWithAPIKey:@"public_sdk_key" appUserID:@"my_app_user_id"];
```
```kotlin
Purchases.debugLogsEnabled = true
Purchases.configure(PurchasesConfiguration.Builder(context, apiKey = "")
            .appUserID("my_app_user_id")
            .build()
```
```java
Purchases.setDebugLogsEnabled(true);
Purchases.configure(new PurchasesConfiguration.Builder(context, "api_key").appUserID("my_app_user_id").build());
```
```javascript
Purchases.SetDebugLogsEnabled(true);
```

  "title": "OS_ACTIVITY_MODE and Common iOS Issues",
  "body": "On iOS, disabling `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE` in your Xcode scheme will block debug logs from printing in the console. If you have debug logs enabled, but don't see any output, go to `Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme...` in Xcode and uncheck the `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE` environment variable.\n\nFlutter projects using Swift may fail to show debug logs in the console if you are using Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, or other IDE's to run your project. We recommend running your Flutter project using Xcode to view debug logs from the Purchases SDK."
}

## Filtering *Purchases* Logs
All logs from the SDK are prepended with "`[Purchases]`", you can use this string as a filter in your log output to clearly see the logs that are from *Purchases*.

## Debug Logs Legend
Emojis currently available on the following platforms:
* Android version >= 4.0.2
* iOS version >= 3.10.1

Messages that have the double red exclamation marks prefix (‚ÄºÔ∏è) attached provides important information regarding your implementation and may require your attention. Paying attention to the source of the message will assist you during the development process. Be sure to address these logs before shipping your app.

# Next Steps

* If you spotted any errors while debugging, make sure you're [handling errors correctly :fa-arrow-right:](doc:errors)
* You've verified that *Purchases* is running correctly, time to start [making purchases in sandbox :fa-arrow-right:](doc:sandbox)
