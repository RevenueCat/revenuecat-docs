# Issues when compiling or archiving

## iOS

** 1. Clean derived data:**  in Xcode, go to Product -> Clean Build Data. 
** 2. Make sure Swift support is enabled in the project:** check that Swift Language Version is defined as at least "Swift 5" in Build Settings for your target.

** 3. Make sure that the deployment target is set correctly:** it should be set to `9.0` or newer for iOS or tvOS, `10.12` or newer for macOS and `6.2` or newer for watchOS. 
** 4. Check the Swift version: ** Check that the value for [`SWIFT_VERSION` isn't overridden by the `Podfile`, if you have one.](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-flutter/issues/168#issuecomment-796468415).
** 5. Enable Swift support: ** If you're getting errors when compiling Swift files after this, try adding a single, empty Swift file to the project. 

### If you're using CocoaPods: 
**1. Make sure you're using the latest version of CocoaPods.** You can see your version by running `pod --version`, and find the [latest version here](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/releases/latest). 
** 2. Re-install pods:** run `pod deintegrate` and then `pod install`, then try running / archiving the project again. 
** 3. Make sure that the deployment target is set correctly:** it should be set to `9.0` or newer for iOS or tvOS, `10.12` or newer for macOS and `6.2` or newer for watchOS. The requirements might be higher if you're using other frameworks, such as React-Native. You should check this value both in the `Podfile`, and by going into the Project settings, then select the target, and look for the value in the general tab:

** 4. Check the Swift version: ** Check that the value for [`SWIFT_VERSION` isn't overridden by the `Podfile`](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-flutter/issues/168#issuecomment-796468415).
** 5. Enable Swift support: ** If you're getting errors when compiling Swift files after this, try adding a single, empty Swift file to the project. 
** 6. If that _still_ doesn't work, then make sure that Swift is added to your Library Search Paths. Go to Build Settings, then look for Library Search Paths, and add `$(SDKROOT)/usr/lib/swift` as the **first** item on the list if it's not present. 

### If you're using Carthage: 
** 1. ** Make sure you're using the latest version of Carthage. 
** 2. ** If you're using XCFrameworks with Carthage, make sure you [follow our installation guide](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/ios#carthage-with-xcframeworks). 

## Flutter
** 1. ** Upgrade to the latest version of [purchases-flutter](https://github.com/revenuecat/purchases-flutter/releases/latest)
** 2. ** Upgrade to the [latest version of Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/upgrading)
** 3. ** Run `pub cache clean`
** 4 **. Follow the [troubleshooting steps for iOS](doc:troubleshooting-the-sdks#ios).
** 5. ** [Check that Flutter doesn't override the minimum deployment version on iOS](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-flutter/issues/189#issuecomment-824189586)

## React-Native
** 1. ** Upgrade to the latest version of [react-native-purchases](https://github.com/revenuecat/react-native-purchases/releases/latest)
** 2. ** Upgrade to the [latest version of React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/upgrading).
** 3. ** If you're setting `BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION` in your Podfile, ensure RevenueCat's targets are excluded.
```ruby 
post_install do |installer|
    react_native_post_install(installer)

    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      unless ['RevenueCat', 'PurchasesHybridCommon', 'RNPurchases'].include?(target.name)
        target.build_configurations.each do |config|
          config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
          config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
        end
      end
    end
  end
```
** 4. ** Follow the [troubleshooting steps for iOS](doc:troubleshooting-the-sdks#ios).
