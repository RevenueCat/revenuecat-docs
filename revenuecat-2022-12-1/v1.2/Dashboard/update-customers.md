The RevenueCat dashboard lets you view basic customer information, including a timeline of their purchases, and allows you to grant promotional subscriptions. This can be a great way to debug issues and help with customer support.
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Customer Information"
}
[/block]
To view a specific customer's information, you'll need to know their [App User Id](doc:user-ids), or find them on the [customers page](https://app.revenuecat.com/customers/).

## Basic Information
Basic customer information, including their total amount spent in your app, is presented at the top of the page.

## Customer History
The 'Customer History' card shows a timeline of transactions and activity for the selected customer. These can be useful for debugging and triaging support issues by understanding when critical events happened for the customer.

## Promotional Subscriptions
Promotional subscriptions allow you to give a user access to premium content for a specific amount of time without requiring them to make a purchase or redeem a promo code. This can be useful for allowing beta users to preview content for free or resolving customer support issues. For more details on promotional subscriptions, jump to [Granting Promotional Subscriptions](customers#section-granting-promotional-subscriptions).

## Aliases
If this customer has any [aliases](doc:user-ids#section-aliases), they will appear in the 'Aliases' card.

      ]
    }

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "body": "If you see unexpected aliases, you may have incorrectly implemented `.createAlias`, `.identify`, or `.restore` methods. See our [guide on App User Ids](doc:user-ids) for more information."
}
[/block]

[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Granting Promotional Subscriptions"
}
[/block]
To give a user promotional access to an entitlement choose the [entitlement name](doc:entitlements) and duration and click 'Grant'. You can grant multiple entitlements if you have different levels of access.

  "images": [
    {

        241,
        "#ebf1f3"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Granting an entitlement from the customer page will go into effect immediately, but you may need to [refresh Purchaser Info](doc:getting-started-1#section-get-subscription-status) on the client to get the latest active entitlements. The promotional access will automatically be revoked after the selected duration.

## Removing Promotional Subscriptions
Granted entitlements will automatically be removed after expiration. To remove access to an entitlement early, click the :fa-times-circle: icon next to the Granted Entitlement name.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "body": "To grant a user promotional access to a subscription, you'll need to be using RevenueCat entitlements to manage access to subscription content in your app.",
  "title": "Promotional subscriptions are for entitlements only"
}
[/block]

[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Delete Users"
}
[/block]
You can delete a user under the 'Manage' card at the bottom of the page. Deleting a user will also remove all their purchase history for sandbox and production data which could change how charts and reports appear. Deleting users should only be used to remove accounts you may have set up for testing.
