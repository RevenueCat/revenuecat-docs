With our Apple Search Ad integration you can:
* Accurately track subscriptions generated from Apple Search Ad campaigns, allowing you to know precisely how much revenue your campaigns generate.
* Send trial conversions and renewals directly to RevenueCat, allowing for tracking without an app open.
* Continue to follow your cohorts for months to know the long tail revenue generated by your campaigns.
