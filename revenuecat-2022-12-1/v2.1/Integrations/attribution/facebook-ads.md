With our Facebook Ads integration you can:
* Accurately track subscriptions generated from Facebook Ad campaigns, allowing you to know precisely how much revenue your campaigns generate.
* Send trial conversions and renewals directly from RevenueCat to Facebook Ads Manager, allowing for tracking without an app open.
* Continue to follow your cohorts for months to know the long tail revenue generated by your campaigns.

Use the `addAttributionData` method to pass the necessary attribution information from Facebook to RevenueCat:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\n    \n    Purchases.configure(withAPIKey: \"my_api_key\", appUserID: \"my_app_user_id\")\n    \n    Purchases.addAttributionData(data, from: .facebook)\n}",
      "language": "swift"
    },
    {
      "code": "- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n  // Override point for customization after application launch.\n  \n  [RCPurchases configureWithAPIKey:@\"my_api_key\" appUserID:@\"my_app_user_id\"];\n  \n  [RCPurchases addAttributionData:attributionData\n                                          fromNetwork:RCAttributionNetworkFacebook];\n  \t\n  return YES;\n}\n",
      "language": "objectivec"
    },
    {
      "code": "\npublic class MainApplication extends Application {\n\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate() {\n        super.onCreate();\n        \n        Purchases.configure(this, \"my_api_key\", \"my_app_user_id\");\n      \n        Purchases.addAttributionData(conversionData, Purchases.AttributionNetwork.FACEBOOK);\n    }\n\n}\n",

    },
    {

  "title": "Remove Facebook SDK Purchase Tracking",
  "body": "Make sure to remove all client side tracking of revenue. Since RevenueCat will be sending events for all revenue actions, tracking purchases with the Facebook SDK directly can lead to double counting of revenue in Facebook Ads Manager."

After you've set up the Purchase SDK to send attribution data from to RevenueCat, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the event names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

## Connect with Facebook

Go to [RevenueCat's dashboard](https://app.revenuecat.com) and click the Login with Facebook button in your app's settings. Once connected, choose the ad account you want RevenueCat to integrate with.

## Set event names
After you've connected your Facebook account, you can enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or choose the default event names. You can also choose whether you want RevenueCat to report proceeds (after app store cut) or revenue (gross sales)
