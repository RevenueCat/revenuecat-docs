With our AppsFlyer integration you can:
* Accurately track subscriptions generated from AppsFlyer campaigns, allowing you to know precisely how much revenue your campaigns generate.
* Send trial conversions and renewals directly from RevenueCat to AppsFlyer, allowing for tracking without an app open.
* Continue to follow your cohorts for months to know the long tail revenue generated by your campaigns.

When you receive the `onConversionDataReceived` callback you can use the `addAttributionData` method for passing the attribution data dictionary:

Use the `networkUserId` parameter to identify the attribution with the unique AppsFlyer device ID. **This parameter is required for the AppsFlyer integration to work properly.**

After you've set up the *Purchase* SDK to send attribution data from AppsFlyer to RevenueCat, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the event names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your app in the RevenueCat dashboard and choose 'AppsFlyer' from the integrations menu
2. Add your developer key and app Ids for iOS and/or Android
3. Enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or choose the default event names
4. Select whether you want RevenueCat to report proceeds (after app store cut) or revenue (gross sales)
