RevenueCat charts allow you to understand your user base with key subscription specific metrics, filters, and segments. All charts are generated from the current snapshot of purchase receipts saved in RevenueCat and work independently from any in-app usage. 

This means that your charts are always up-do-date, without having to rely on any client-side event logging. However, since receipt files are dynamic, this means even historical data may change from day-to-day if for example a user was refunded. This also means that data in RevenueCat may be different than other systems tracking similar metrics - see the section on [Differences In Data](doc:charts#differences-in-data) for more information.

## Monthly Recurring Revenue
**Segments:** Yes
**Filters:** Yes
The Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) chart is the benchmark of the size and growth of your subscriber base and your business. 

The calculation takes revenue amortized to a 28-day period (not including any platform fees or taxes). This means an annual subscription purchased for $100 will show as $7.67 MRR (100/365\*28), and a weekly subscription purchased for $2.99 will show as $11.96 MRR (2.99/7\*28).

## Revenue
**Segments:** Yes
**Filters:** Yes
The Revenue chart shows the gross revenue (not including taxes and VAT) generated by subscription and non-subscription purchases during a given period. This means a yearly subscription purchased for $100 will count all $100 toward revenue for that day.

The chart breaks down proceeds after app store fees (either 70% or 85%) and can be useful for forecasting cashflow and store payouts.

## New Purchases & Trials
**Segments:** Yes
**Filters:** Yes
The New Purchases & Trials chart shows the number of subscriptions that started during a given period. Note that it is possible for a single user to start multiple subscriptions in the same period, if for example they start a trial for a monthly subscription then switch to an annual subscription.

This chart is useful for tracking the acceleration (is the number of new users increasing every week?) and is powerful when combined with [filters and segments](doc:charts#section-filters-and-segments) to understand what is driving new subscriptions.

## Active Subscriptions & Trials
**Segments:** Yes
**Filters:** Yes
The Active Subscriptions & Trials chart shows the total number of active subscriptions, including trials, during a given period. Note that it is possible for a single user to have multiple subscriptions. A subscription is considered active as long as the user has access, regardless of whether the subscription will renew or not.

Usually this chart is highly correlated to MRR, and when combined with [filters and segments](doc:charts#section-filters-and-segments) can help understand the long-term value of certain user groups.

## Trial Conversion
**Segments:** No
**Filters:** Yes
The Trial Conversion chart shows just that: the percentage of free trials that convert to paid subscriptions. The calculation is (number of trials converted to paid) / (number of trials eligible to convert) \* 100. Note that this calculation doesn't consider users who never start a trial (trial start rate).

Trial conversion rates are an important metric for understanding your new user flow and the growth of your subscriber base.

}
[/block]
## Churn
**Segments:** No
**Filters:** Yes
Churn is the percentage of paid subscriptions that were lost during a given period. The calculation is (number of subscriptions expired during period) / (number of paid subscriptions at the start of the period) \* 100. Note that a subscription isn't counted as expired until the user no longer has access. This means users that turn off auto-renew aren't counted as "churned" until their subscription expires. If you're app offers multiple subscriptions, it's possible to have "negative churn" if users are subscribing to multiple products - this is known as expansion.

Churn can be relatively high for mobile apps when compared to web SaaS products. Like trial conversion, churn is another metric you should continuously monitor and work to improve. By combining churn and trial conversion you can start to make longer-term forecasts of the lifetime value of your subscribers.

## Auto Renew Status
**Segments:** No
**Filters:** Yes
Auto Renew Status shows a snapshot of the active subscriptions today, segmented by whether they are set to renew or not. This chart isn't plotted over a timeseries since it is independent of when the user purchased the subscription.

This chart can be especially helpful when filtered to only show subscriptions with an 'annual' duration, as you can start to forecast long-term churn before the subscription actually expires.

## Cohorts
**Segments:** No
**Filters:** Yes
The Cohorts table lets you see when in their lifecycle subscribers are churning. The Initial Cohort shows the number of new subscribers that were added in the month. As you move left to right you'll see how much of the initial cohort remained subscribed in the subsequent months. 

The cohorts table can help you understand if there's a certain point where the majority of your subscribers drop off. If it's early on, try to offer more value for new users or offer a longer trial.

  "title": "Filters and Segments"
}
[/block]
All charts can be filtered, while revenue and subscriber charts can be filtered and/or segmented.

Filters allow you to limit the charts to only include data that matches one or more attributes. This is useful when you want to check the performance of a specific property, such as a certain country or product identifier. 

Segments allow you to break down the chart totals into underlying data segments. This is useful for comparing the performance of specific properties, such as monthly vs. annual subscriptions.

All of the charts in RevenueCat are generated from a snapshot of the current state of all receipts from your app. This is different than other analytics systems that may use event based metrics and counters to track values. This also means that data for any historical point in time may change if a receipt file is added or updated.

When comparing data in RevenueCat to other systems, keep in mind any reporting differences between the systems such as timezones, calculations, and whether the underlying source data is the same.
