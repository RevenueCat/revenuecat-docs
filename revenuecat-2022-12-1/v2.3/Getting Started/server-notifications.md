RevenueCat does not require server notifications from the App Store or Play Store, however doing so can speed up webhook and integration delivery times and reduce lag time for [Charts](doc:charts).

[Google real-time developer notifications](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/realtime_developer_notifications) can be set up directly from the RevenueCat dashboard. This will set up a new subscriber to Google's subscription status notifications, which will not effect any existing subscribers you may already have in place.

1. Navigate to your **app settings** in the RevenueCat dashboard.
2. Scroll to the **Android configuration** section, and click '*Connect to Google*' under **Google Developer Notifications**.
3. You will see a generated Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic ID, as shown below.

4. Click the **Copy** button to copy the topic ID to your clipboard.
5. Open the Google Play Console for your app and navigate to **Development Tools** â†’ **Services & APIs**.
6. In the "Real-time developer notifications" section, paste in your topic ID, click on **Save**, and then the **Send Test Notification** button.

If you don't see any errors, the subscription is ready to go.

You can confirm the Apple and/or Google notifications are being delivered properly to RevenueCat by observing the '*Last received*' timestamp next to the section header. If you've had subscription activity in your app but this value is missing or stale double check the configuration steps above.
