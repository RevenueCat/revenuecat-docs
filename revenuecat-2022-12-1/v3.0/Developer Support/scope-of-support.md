For help with code that's specific to your project, we recommend the awesome community on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/revenuecat). We're not experts in every programming language, so it's tough to provide answers to coding questions through support tickets. Our engineers regularly monitor the `revenuecat` tag on Stack Overflow and jump in whenever they can help.

### Services outside of RevenueCat
We're not able to troubleshoot or debug problems with other products and services. We probably don't have the expertise anyway, and may just make things worse. If you believe there is a problem with RevenueCat, try to isolate the issue from other services before submitting a ticket.

### Phone support
Since most of the support tickets we receive are technical, it's more effective for us to route requests to the correct resource internally and work through issues asynchronously. In some circumstances, a call may be the the best option but we try to avoid it if at all possible.

### General consulting services
We don't provide direct consulting or app development services. Our [community](https://community.revenuecat.com) provides a great forum to discuss the design and architecture of apps.
