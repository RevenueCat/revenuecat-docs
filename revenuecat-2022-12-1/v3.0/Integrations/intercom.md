RevenueCat can automatically send subscription events to Intercom. This can be helpful in understanding what stage a customer is in to react accordingly. For example, you might want to:
- Send an onboarding campaign to a user in a free trial
- Allow customer support grant a [promotional subscription](doc:customers#section-granting-promotional-subscriptions) to a loyal user that experienced issues
- Create Intercom filters for users that cancelled free trials

With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in Intercom, you'll be set to turbo charge your customer support ⚡️
