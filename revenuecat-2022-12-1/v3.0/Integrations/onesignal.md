RevenueCat can automatically update user tags in OneSignal with their latest subscription status. This can be helpful in understanding what stage a customer is in to react accordingly. For example, you might want to:
- Send an onboarding campaign to a user in a free trial
- Send a push notification to churned users and [offer them a discount](doc:ios-subscription-offers) 

With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in OneSignal, you'll be set to turbo charge your campaigns.

For every auto-renewing subscription event in RevenueCat, the following tags get added or updated on the user in OneSignal. By leaving the tag blank in the RevenueCat dashboard, you can choose to not send any value for specific tag(s).

The OneSignal integration requires some device-specific data. RevenueCat will only update users in OneSignal if the below data has been added as [Subscriber Attributes](doc:subscriber-attributes) for the user.
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Key",
    "h-1": "Description",
    "h-2": "Required",
    "0-2": "âœ…",
    "0-0": "`$onesignalId`",
    "0-1": "The [OneSignal Player Id](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/users#player-id) for the user."
  },
  "cols": 3,
  "rows": 1
}
[/block]
This data should be sent to RevenueCat through reserved [Subscriber Attributes](doc:subscriber-attributes) keys. You can listen for changes to the OneSignal Id through their SDK, and send the value to RevenueCat. If you already have OneSignal set up, you should make sure that you're also sending the OneSignal Id for users that are updating to the latest version of your app.

After you've set up the *Purchase* SDK to send device data to RevenueCat, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the tag names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your app in the RevenueCat dashboard and choose 'OneSignal' from the integrations menu.
2. Add your OneSignal App Id and OneSignal API key.
3. Enter the tag names that RevenueCat should use, or choose the default tag names.

}
[/block]
You can test the OneSignal integration end-to-end before going live. It's recommended that you test the integration is working properly for new users, and any existing users that may update their app to a new version.

### Make a sandbox purchase with a new user
Simulate a new user installing your app, and go through your app flow to complete a sandbox purchase.

### Check that the OneSignal event delivered successfully
While still on the Customer View, click into the test purchase event in the [Customer History](doc:customer-history) and make sure that the OneSignal integration event exists and was delivered successfully.
