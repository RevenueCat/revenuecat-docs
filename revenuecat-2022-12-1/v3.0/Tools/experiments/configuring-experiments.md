Before setting up an experiment, make sure you've created the products and offerings that you want to test and added any new products to the appropriate entitlements. You should also test the offerings you've chosen on any platforms your app supports.

### Setting up a new experiment

Click New and enter the following details:

- Experiment name
- Variant A - first offering
- Variant B - second offering

{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "",
  "body": "The order of the variants doesn't matter. The experiment will try to test each offering equally."
}
[/block]
Once done, click Add and view your new experiment.

### Starting an experiment

When viewing a new experiment, you can start, edit, or delete the experiment.

- Start: Starts the experiment. Data collection and LTV begins immediately, but how quickly results start showing up depends on how active your users are.
- Edit: Choose different offerings for the experiment.
- Delete: Deletes the experiment.
