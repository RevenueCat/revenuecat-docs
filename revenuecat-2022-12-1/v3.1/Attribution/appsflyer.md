With our AppsFlyer integration you can:
* Accurately track subscriptions generated from AppsFlyer campaigns, allowing you to know precisely how much revenue your campaigns generate.
* Send trial conversions and renewals directly from RevenueCat to AppsFlyer, allowing for tracking without an app open.
* Continue to follow your cohorts for months to know the long tail revenue generated by your campaigns.

# 1. Install Appsflyer SDK

Before RevenueCat can integrate with Appsflyer, your app should be running the latest Appsflyer SDK. Refer to the [Appsflyer developer documentation](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/categories/201114756) for the latest installation instructions.

# 2. Send device data to RevenueCat

The Appsflyer integration requires some device-specific data. RevenueCat will only send events into Appsflyer if the below [Subscriber Attributes](doc:subscriber-attributes) keys have been set for the device.
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Key",
    "h-1": "Description",
    "h-2": "Required",
    "1-0": "`$idfa`",
    "2-0": "`$gpsAdId`",
    "3-0": "`$androidId`",
    "1-2": "✅ (recommended)",
    "2-2": "✅ (recommended)",
    "3-2": "✅ (recommended)",
    "5-2": "❌ (optional)",
    "5-0": "`$ip`",
    "1-1": "iOS [advertising identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/adsupport/asidentifiermanager/1614151-advertisingidentifier) UUID",
    "2-1": "Google [advertising identifier](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/identifier/AdvertisingIdClient.Info)",
    "5-1": "The IP address of the device",
    "3-1": "Android [device identifier](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID)",
    "4-0": "`$idfv`",
    "4-1": "iOS [vender identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/1620059-identifierforvendor) UUID",
    "4-2": "✅ (recommended)",
    "0-0": "`$appsflyerId`",
    "0-1": "Appsflyer Id. The unique Appsflyer identifier for the user",
    "0-2": "✅ (required)"
  },
  "cols": 3,
  "rows": 6
}
[/block]
These properties can be set manually, like any other [Subscriber Attributes](doc:subscriber-attributes), or through the helper methods to `collectDeviceIdentifiers()` and `setAppsflyerId()`. 
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "import AdSupport\n// ...\nPurchases.configure(withAPIKey: \"public_sdk_key\")\n// ...\n\n// Automatically collect the $idfa, $idfv, and $ip values\nPurchases.shared.collectDeviceIdentifiers() \n\n// Set the Appsflyer Id\nPurchases.shared.setAppsflyerID(AppsFlyerLib.shared().getAppsFlyerUID())",
      "language": "swift",
      "name": "Swift"
    },
    {
      "code": "//..\nPurchases.configure(this, \"public_sdk_key\")\n//..\n  \n// Automatically collect the $gpsAdId, $androidId, and $ip values\nPurchases.sharedInstance.collectDeviceIdentifiers()\n  \n// Set the Appsflyer Id\nPurchases.sharedInstance.setAppsflyerID(AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().getAppsFlyerUID(this));",
      "language": "kotlin"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
You should make sure to set attributes after the *Purchases SDK* is configured, and before the first purchase occurs. It's safe to set this multiple times, as only the new/updated values will be sent to RevenueCat.

## (Optional) Send campaign data to RevenueCat
RevenueCat itself is not an attribution network, and can't determine which specific ad drove an install/conversion. However, if you're able to collect this information from another source, such as Appsflyer, it's possible to attach it to a user in RevenueCat using [Subscriber Attributes](doc:subscriber-attributes)  as well.
The below reserved key names can be used to optionally attach campaign data to a user. This data will then be sent through to other downstream analytics integrations and accessible via APIs and webhooks.
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Key",
    "0-0": "`$mediaSource`",
    "1-0": "`$campaign`",
    "2-0": "`$adGroup`",
    "3-0": "`$ad`",
    "4-0": "`$keyword`",
    "5-0": "`$creative`"
  },

  "rows": 6
}
[/block]
# 3. Send RevenueCat events into AppsFlyer

After you've set up the *Purchase* SDK to send attribution data from AppsFlyer to RevenueCat, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the event names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your app in the RevenueCat dashboard and choose 'AppsFlyer' from the integrations menu
2. Add your developer key and app Ids for iOS and/or Android
3. Enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or choose the default event names
4. Select whether you want RevenueCat to report proceeds (after app store cut) or revenue (gross sales)

# 4. Testing the Appsflyer integration

You can test the Appsflyer integration end-to-end before going live. It's recommended that you test the integration is working properly for new users, and any existing users that may update their app to a new version.

## Add a sandbox API key in the RevenueCat dashboard
Before you test the integration, make sure you have an Appsflyer API key set in the "Sandbox developer key" field in RevenueCat. This is required if you want the integration to trigger for sandbox purchases.

## Make a sandbox purchase with a new user
Simulate a new user installing your app, and go through your app flow to complete a sandbox purchase.

## Check that the required device data is collected
Navigate the the [Customer View](doc:customers) for the test user that just made a purchase. Make sure that all of the required data from step 1 above is listed as attributes for the user.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## Check that the Appsflyer  event delivered successfully
While still on the Customer View, click into the test purchase event in the [Customer History](doc:customer-history) and make sure that the AppsFlyer integration event exists and was delivered successfully.
