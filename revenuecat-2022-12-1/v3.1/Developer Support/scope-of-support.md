Building apps can be tough, but we're here to help where we can! We try to be as responsive as possible to any issues submitted to our [community](https://community.revenuecat.com). 

We also do our best to triage requests by severity, to make sure urgent issues get addressed first.

# Help with code

For help with code that's specific to your project, we recommend the awesome community on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/revenuecat). We're not experts in every programming language, so it's tough to provide answers to coding questions through support tickets. Our engineers regularly monitor the `revenuecat` tag on Stack Overflow and jump in whenever they can help.

# Help with best practices

Our [Developer Community](https://community.revenuecat.com) is designed to be a place to discover and engage with other developers regarding best practices and questions around using RevenueCat.

# Things out of scope

## Services outside of RevenueCat
We're not able to troubleshoot or debug problems with other products and services. We probably don't have the expertise anyway, and may just make things worse. If you believe there is a problem with RevenueCat, try to isolate the issue from other services before submitting a ticket.

## Phone support
Since most of the support tickets we receive are technical, it's more effective for us to route requests to the correct resource internally and work through issues asynchronously. In some circumstances, a call may be the the best option but we try to avoid it if at all possible.

## General consulting services
We don't provide direct consulting or app development services. Our [community](https://community.revenuecat.com) provides a great forum to discuss the design and architecture of apps.
