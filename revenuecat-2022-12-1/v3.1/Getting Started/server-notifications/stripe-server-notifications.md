# Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to your **app settings** in the RevenueCat dashboard.
2. Scroll to the **Stripe Configuration** section and copy the endpoint provided under **Stripe Webhook Endpoint**.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]
3. Log in to Stripe and go to the [Webhooks dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks).
4. Click **Add endpoint**, paste the URL in the endpoint URL field and select the "customer.subscription.updated" event. It's very important to only select this specific event, since it's the only one that contains information relevant to RevenueCat.

  "body": "The only event for this webhook should be the **customer.subscription.updated** event. If you choose other events, our API will respond with an error, and Stripe will eventually disable the webhook."
