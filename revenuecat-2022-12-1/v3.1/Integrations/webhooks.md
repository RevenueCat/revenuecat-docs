RevenueCat can send you notifications any time an event happens in your app. This is useful for subscription and purchase events, which will allow you to monitor state changes for your subscribers and react accordingly. 

For example, you might want to remind subscribers of the benefits of your app when they decide to unsubscribe, or let them know when there are billing issues. 

# Registering Your Webhook URL

To start receiving webhook events, register your server URL for your app using [RevenueCat's dashboard](http://app.revenuecat.com). 
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "One webhook per app",
  "body": "Each of your apps has a webhook URL field you can set. This way you can decide which of your apps need server side notifications, and where they should be sent."
}
[/block]
RevenueCat will send `POST` requests to your server, in which the body will be a JSON representation of the notification. Your server should return a **200 status code**. Any other status code will be considered a failure by our backend. RevenueCat will retry later (up to 5 times) with an increasing delay (5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 minutes). After 5 retries, we will stop sending notifications.

If you're receiving a webhook it's important to respond quickly so you don't accidentally run over a timeout limit. We recommend that apps defer processing until after the response has been sent.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "Best Practices: Webhook authorization",
  "body": "We recommended setting an authorization header value via the RevenueCat dashboard. When set, RevenueCat will send this header in every request. Your server can use this to authenticate the  webhooks from RevenueCat."

## Events Format

Webhook events are serialized in JSON. The body of a `POST` request to your server will contain the serialized event, as well as the API version.

# Testing

You can test your server side implementation by purchasing [sandbox subscriptions](doc:sandbox) or by issuing test webhook events through [RevenueCat's dashboard](http://app.revenuecat.com).

When testing with sandbox purchases, the `environment` value will be `SANDBOX`. RevenueCat itself does not have sandbox and production environments, so this value is only determined by the type of transaction received from the store. The same customer in RevenueCat can have both sandbox and production transactions associated with their account. 

# Syncing Subscription Status
Webhooks are commonly used to keep a subscribers status in sync with RevenueCat across multiple systems. To simplify the logic of handling different webhook types, we recommend creating a polling system using the `GET /subscribers` [REST API](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference#subscribers) to sync the subscription status of the customer from RevenueCat to your database. Then, each webhook event can simply be a trigger to call this sync function. This approach has a few benefits and can make your system more robust and scalable. 

# Security and Best Practices

## Authorization
You can configure the authorization header used for webhook requests via the [dashboard](https://app.revenuecat.com/). Your server should verify the validity of the authorization header for every notification.

## Response Duration
If your server doesn't finish the response in 60s, RevenueCat will disconnect. We then retry up to 5 times. We recommend that apps respond quickly and defer processing until after the response has been sent.

## Delivery Delays
Most webhooks are usually delivered within 5 to 60 seconds of the event occurring - cancellation events usually are delivered within 2hrs of the user cancelling their subscription. You should be aware of these delivery times when designing your app.

## Future Proofing
You should be able to handle webhooks that include additional fields to what's shown here, including new event types. We may add new fields or event types in the future without changing the API version. We *won't* remove fields or events without proper API versioning and deprecation.

# Sample Webhook Events

These are some representative samples of webhooks you might receive from RevenueCat. Keep in mind that webhooks can include additional fields to what's shown here.
