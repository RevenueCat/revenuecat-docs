With our Apple Search Ad integration you can:
* Continue to follow your campaign's install base for months to understand the long-tail revenue generated from subscriptions, even without an app open.
* Filter and segment RevenueCat charts by Apple Search Ad campaigns or ad groups.

# 1. Send attribution data to RevenueCat 

The *Purchases SDK* can automatically collect Apple Search Ad attribution data as long as you import the iAd framework to your Xcode project and set `automaticAttributionCollection = true`.

[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "import iAd\n...\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\n\t\t\n    Purchases.automaticAppleSearchAdsAttributionCollection = true\n    Purchases.configure(withAPIKey: \"public_sdk_key\", appUserID: \"my_app_user_id\")\n    \n    return true\n}",
      "language": "swift",
      "name": "Swift"
    },
    {
      "code": "#import <iAd/iAd.h>\n... \n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application \n  didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n  \n  RCPurchases.automaticAppleSearchAdsAttributionCollection = YES;\n  [RCPurchases configureWithAPIKey:@\"public_sdk_key\" appUserID:@\"my_app_user_id\"];\n\n}",
      "language": "objectivec",
      "name": "Objective-C"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Don't forget to import the iAd framework to your XCode project.

# 2. View attribution data in RevenueCat

After the *Purchases SDK* has collected attribution for some users, you'll be able to segment and view charts for those conversions.

## Choose conversion level
In the 'Select Segment' dropdown choose *Campaign* or *Ad Group* from the Apple Search Ads section.
