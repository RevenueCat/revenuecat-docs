The 'Active Users' card displays the number of App User IDs that have communicated with RevenueCat in the past 28 days. Active users should be higher than 'Installs' if your app is retaining users and they keep coming back after 28 days. Multiple App User IDs aliased together will be counted as 1 active user.

[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Sandbox Data"
}
[/block]
The sandbox data toggle will change the Overview metrics to report from sandbox purchases or production purchases. There's no concept of a sandbox or production *user* in RevenueCat, since the same App User Id can have both production and sandbox receipts. Because of this, **the 'View sandbox data' toggle will not affect 'Installs' or 'Active User' cards**.
