# What is RevenueCat?

RevenueCat provides a backend and a wrapper around StoreKit and Google Play Billing to make implementing in-app purchases and subscriptions easy. With our SDK, you can build and manage your app business on any platform without having to maintain IAP infrastructure. You can read more about [how RevenueCat fits into your app](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/where-does-revenuecat-fit-in-your-app) or you can [sign up free](https://app.revenuecat.com/signup) to start building.

# Android
## Installation

Purchases for Android (Google Play and Amazon Appstore) is available on Maven and can be included via Gradle.

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/RevenueCat/purchases-android.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/releases)
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "implementation 'com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases:4.3.1'",
      "language": "groovy",
      "name": "build.gradle"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## Import Purchases

You should now be able to import `Purchases`.
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "import com.android.billingclient.api.SkuDetails;\nimport com.revenuecat.purchases.Entitlement;\nimport com.revenuecat.purchases.Offering;\nimport com.revenuecat.purchases.PurchaserInfo;\nimport com.revenuecat.purchases.Purchases;",
      "language": "java"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## Configure Proguard

You should add `-keep class com.revenuecat.purchases.** { *; }` to your Proguard configuration.

# Amazon

## Additional Dependencies

Add a new dependency to the build.gradle apart from the regular `purchases` dependency. These new dependencies have the classes needed to use Amazon IAP:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "implementation 'com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases:5.0.0-rc1'\nimplementation 'com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-store-amazon:5.0.0-rc1'",
      "language": "groovy",
      "name": "build.gradle"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Due to some limitations, RevenueCat will only validate purchases made in production or in Live App Testing and won't validate purchases made with the Amazon App Tester.

# Next Steps

* Now that you've installed the Purchases SDK in your Android app, get started by [configuring an instance of Purchases :fa-arrow-right:](doc:getting-started-1#section-configure-purchases)
