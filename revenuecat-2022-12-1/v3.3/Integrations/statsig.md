RevenueCat can automatically send billing, subscription, and revenue metrics to your Statsig project. This can be helpful in optimizing purchases and revenue, and understanding which features are causing product metrics to move. For example, you might want to:
* Compute how every new product improvement impacts your business metrics
* Simplify setting up Feature Gates and be able to automatically A/B test new features
* Run multiple independent experiments in parallel

# Events
The Statsig integration tracks the following events:

    "4-0": "Cancellation",
    "4-1": "A subscription or non-renewing purchase has been cancelled.",

# Setup 
## 1. Set Statsig User Identity

In order to associate RevenueCat data with Statsig feature gate and/or experiment, the RevenueCat app user ID must match the Statsig User ID. You can read more about Statsig user IDs in their documentation [here](https://docs.statsig.com/server/python/index#statsig-user). You can set up a custom app user ID in RevenueCat by following the instructions in our [Identifying Users](doc:user-ids#provided-app-user-id) documentation. 

## 2. Enable RevenueCat integration with Statsig

On the Statsig [Integration page](https://console.statsig.com/integrations) enable the RevenueCat integration.

# Testing the Statsig integration

## Enable Sandbox Events in Statsig
Ingesting sandbox events into Statsig can be enabled in the RevenueCat configuration in the Statsig [Integration page](https://console.statsig.com/integrations).

## Make a sandbox purchase with a new user
Simulate a new user installing your app, and go through your app flow to complete a sandbox purchase.

## Check that the Statsig event delivered successfully
While still on the Customer View, select the purchase event in the [Customer History](doc:customer-history) page and make sure that the Statsig integration event exists and was delivered successfully.
