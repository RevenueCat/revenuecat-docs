RevenueCat can send you Slack message to a channel any time an event happens in your app. This lets you keep a close pulse on your app and celebrate those money making moments!

With our Slack integration, you can:
- Receive feedback or reviews from customers real-time, posted to a dedicated channel in your slack workspace.

# Configure Slack Workspace

Before RevenueCat can post to your Slack channel, you need to authorize a webhook to post to your workspace. Slack has a more [detailed article](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115005265063-Incoming-WebHooks-for-Slack) on their website explaining how to set this up if you have trouble.

## 1. Create a **Slack app**
* Navigate to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) and create a new app. Give it a name like "RevenueCat" and select your workspace.
