RevenueCat does not require server notifications from Google Play, however doing so can speed up webhook and integration delivery times and reduce lag time for [Charts](doc:charts).

# Setup Instructions

[Google real-time developer notifications](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/realtime_developer_notifications) can be set up directly from the RevenueCat dashboard. This will set up a new subscriber to Google's subscription status notifications, which will not affect any existing subscribers you may already have in place.

1. **Ensure Google Cloud Pub/Sub is enabled for your project**. You can enable it [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=pubsub).

5. Click the **Copy** button to copy the topic ID to your clipboard.
6. Open the Google Play Console for your app and navigate to **Monetization setup**.
